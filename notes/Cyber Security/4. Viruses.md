# Viruses

- A program that piggybacks on other executable programs
- Not structured to exist by iteself
- When host program executes, the virus code also executes and performs its actions
- Typically, actions may be
    - Spreading itself to other programs or disks
    - Delete files
    - Cause systems to become unusable

# Common Ways for Viruses To Get Into Computers

- Contaminated media
- Through email or peer-to-peer sites
- Part of another program

# Types of Viruses

- Armored virus
- Companion virus
- Macro virus
- Multipartite virus
- Phage virus
- Polymorphic virus
- Retrovirus virus
- Stealth virus

## Armored Virus

- Designed to make itself difficult to detect or analyze
- Cover themselves with protective code to stop debuggers, disassemblies from examining critical elements of the virus
- Some part of the code may also act as a decoy to distract analysis
- Need to be identified quickly

## Companion Virus

- Attaches itself to legitimate program and then creates a program with a different filename extension
- When a user types the name of the legitimate program, the companion virus executes instead of the real virus
- Or make changes to program pointers in the registry so that they point to the infected program
- The infected program performs its dirty deeds and then starts the real program

## Macro Virus

- It exploits the enhancements made to many applications
- E.g. Word supports a mini BASIC programming language that allows files to be manipulated automatically (e.g. spell check when document opens), these are macros
- Macro virus infects such macros such that the related documents are infected and can spread to other systems via attached documents in an email

## Multipartite Virus

- Attacks your system in multiple ways
- May infect your boot sectors, all your executable files and destroy your application files (e.g. MS words documents) at the same time
- The key is that you won't be able to correct all the problems and will allow infestation to continue

## Phage Virus

- It modifies other programs and databases
- Require reinstallation of programs or databases to remove virus

## Polymorphic Virus

- The virus changes forms in order to avoid detection
- Attempt to hide from your antivirus program by
    - Encrypting itself
    - Mutation
- Change its signature to fool the antivirus program

## Retrovirus

- Bypasses the antivirus program
- May directly attack the antivirus program
- Destroy the virus definition database file
- May leave you with a false sense of security

## Stealth Virus

- Hide from antivirus program by masking itself from the applicatoin
- May attach itself to the boot sector
- Redirects commands to avoid detectoin
- Report a different file size
- Move around from file to file (from file A which is not scanned, to file B which is already scanned)

# Virus Transmission

- Some viruses destroy the target system immediately
- Some uses the victim sysetm as a carrier to infect other servers, shared files and other resources in a network. It then eventually infects the original victim system and destroy it completely.

# Worm 

- A program that crawls itself from system to system without any assistance of its victims
- Spreads on its own and replicates on its own
- Creator of a worm seek out system vulnerabilities to get the worm started
- The internet may have to be shut down due to a infestation of a worm

# Trojan Horse

- Hides its malicious nature behind the facade of something useful or interesting
- Complete and self-contained program that is designed to perform some malicious actions
- Disguises itself as a new capability or as an email that is attractive or interesting to read
- May contain mechanisms to spread itself

## Example: Melissa: both virus and worm
- The worm part allowed it to travel from system to system
- Virus part replicated itself on local systems and did damage

# Logic Bomb

- Program or snippet of codes that execute when a certain predefined event occurs
- Events could also be based on a certain date (eg, Christmas) or set of circumstances (certain employee has been sacked)
- It could send a message back to the attacker or launch an attack such as DDoS or grant access to the victim system at attacker choice or time

# Software Attacks

- Polymorphic threat - evolves to elude detection
- Virus and worm hoaxes: nonexistent malware that employees waste time spreading awareness about
- Backdoor: gaining access to system or network using known or previously unknown, newly discovered systems

- Denial of service - An attacker sends a large number of conection or information requests to a target
    - The target system becomes overloaded and cannot respond to legitimate requests for service
    - May result in system crash or inability to perform ordinary
- Distributed denial of service: A corodinated stream of requests is launcehd against a target from manh locations simultaneously
- Code Red and Numda viruses caused extensive damage to businesses worldwide by causing DoS attacks that cuased over $3 billion in damages

- Mail bombing (also a DoS): An attacker sends a large quantity of emails to overwhelm the server
- Spam (unsolicited commercial email): Considered more of a nuisance than an attack, but can be used as a vector of attack
- Packet sniffer: Monitors network traffic, Can be used for both legitimate management purposes and stealing of data over a network
- Spoofing: A technique used to gain unauthorised access to a server by pretending to be a authorised user. The intruder assumes a trusted IP address
- Pharming: Attack's a user's browser bar and redirects the user to an illegitimate website for the purpose of obtaining private information
- Man-in-the-middle: An attacker monitors network packets, modifies them, and inserts them back into the network

# Technical Hardware Failures and Errors

- Occurs when a manufacturer distributes equipment containing a known or unknown flaw
- Can cause system to perform outside of expected parameters, resulting in unreliable performance or lack of availability of service
- Some errors are terminal, some are intermittent
- Mean time between failures: Measures the amount of time between hardware failures

# Technical Software Failures and Errors

- Large quantities of computer code are written, debugged and published before all bugs can be fixed
- Combinations of certain software may reveal new bugs
- Open Web Application Security Project [(OWASP)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) is dedicated to help organisations create secure applications, and publishes a list of top security risks

# Sofware Vulnerability

- The developer creates a software containing a vulnerability
- Attacker finds the vulnerability before the developer finds and fixes it
    - Or developer is aware of vulnerability, but neglects it due to budget/time constraints
    - Or developer is unable to fix it
- The attacker writes/uses/distributes an exploit for the vulnerability
- Developer/public becomes aware of the exploit, and then developer becomes forced to work on a fix (if not already working on one)
- Developer releases a patch

# Install Patches ASAP

- Zero-day attack
    - The developer had zero days to patch
- Once a patch is available, it is no longer a zero-day exploit
    - Install patches as soon as possible

# Common Failures in Software Development

- Budget overruns
- Command injections
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Failure to handle errors
- Failure to protect network traffic
- Failure to store and protect data securely
- Failure to use cryptographically strong random numbers

- Format string problems
- Neglecting change control
- Improper file access
- Improper SSL usage
- Information leakage
- Integer bugs (Overflow/underflow)
- Race conditions
- SQL injections

# Problem Areas in Software Development

- Trusting network address resolution
- Unauthenticated key exchange
- Use of magic URLs and hidden forms
- Use of weak password-based systems
- Poor usability

# Spyware

- A program used to gather information about a person or organisation without their knowledge
    - May send information over to another entity without consent
    - May assert control over a user's computer without their knowledge
    - 4 types
        - System monitors (e.g. keyloggers)
        - Trojans
        - Adware
        - Tracking cookies
- Spyware is legally used or made by the government
    - Govware in Germany, Switzerland 2007
    - Policeware: installed on suspect's computers

# Computer Network and Surveillance

- The monitoring of computer activity, data stored on a hard drive, or data being transferred over computer networks such as the Internet, corporate networks and phone networks
    - Recognize and monitor threats
    - Maintain social stability
    - Prevent/investigate criminal activity
- Possible data analysis
    - Public data: Social networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook
    - Private data: Personal emails, SMS, GPS locations etc.

# Browser Hijacking

- The modification of a user's web browser without their knowledge
    - A browser hijacker may replace the user's home webpage with its own
- Some browser hijacking can be easily reversed, while other instances may not be as easy
    - Various software exist to prevent modification of the user's web browser and remove browser hijackers
- Most installers provide the user an opportunity to accept or decline the installation of the hijacker
    - However people do not read and accept to install the hijacker

# Theft

- Illegal taking of a another's physical, electronic or intellectual property
- Physical theft can be easily controlled
- Electronic theft is more complex, evidence of crime is not readily available

# Antivirus

2 common methods for virus and worm detection

1. Signature
    - A unique string of program that cannot be found in any other program
    - Protected only from worms/viruses in the antivirus signature list
    - Must update antivirus software to update the list
    - Else, not protected from new viruses
2. Heuristic Algorithm
    - False positive can be disruptive, especially in a commercial environment

Options provided by antivirus once a virus is discovered

- If possible, clean the virus from the file without damaging the file
- Quarantine the infected file
- If impossible to clean the virus from the file without damaging the file, delete the file that contains the virus

# Backup

- Perform regular backups of data on to different media
- If you have the time, back up the entire operating system

# Technological Obsolesence

- Antiquated or outdated infrastructure can lead to untrustworthy or unreliable systems
- Proper managerial planning required to prevent technological obsolesence
- IT plays a large role

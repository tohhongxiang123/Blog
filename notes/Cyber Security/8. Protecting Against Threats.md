# Protecting Against Threats

# Cryptography

- The study of ways to hide or obscure information, making it unreadable without secret knowledge
- Cryptography is the use of mathematical operations to protect messages travelling between parties or stored on a computer
- It means that someone intercepting your communications cannot read them

## Basic Cryptography Definitions

- Plaintext: Unencrypted data
- Ciphertext: Output of encryption algorithm
- Cipher: Cryptographic algorithm
- Key: Sequence of characters or bits used by an algorithm to encrypt or decrypt a message
- Encryption: Changing plaintext to ciphertext
- Decryption: Changing ciphertext to plaintext

## Encryption and Decryption Process

- $M$ - Message, $C$ - Ciphertext, $E$ - Encryption, $D$ - Decryption
- $E(M) = C$ - Encrypting message = Ciphertext
- $D(C) = M$ - Decrypting ciphertext = message

With a Key,

- Secret-key (Symmetric) cryptosystem - One key
    - $E_k(M) = C$
    - $D_k(C) = M$
- Public-key (Asymmetric) cryptosystem - Two keys
    - $E_k_1(M) = C$
    - $D_k_2(C) = M$

## Cryptographic Algorithms

A cryptographic algorithm - or encryption algorithm or cipher - is made up of mathematical steps for encrypting and decrypting information. There are many different types of ciphers

- Substitution ciphers (replace)
- Transposition ciphers (rearrange)
- Product ciphers (substitution, permutation, modular arithmetic)
- Vigenere cipher
- One-time pad

Cryptographic algorithms use a **key**
- Special pieces of data used in both the encryption and decryption process
- Algorithms stay the same, but a different key is used
- The more complex the key, the greater the security of the system

### Key Length

- Security = Strength of algorithm + Length of key
- Key of 8 bits has $2^8 = 256$ possible combinations. Trivial to break even without a cmoputer
- Every extra bit doubles the number of posible combinations

### Encrypting Plaintext

Plaintext can be encrypted through stream cipher or block cipher method

#### Stream Cipher

A typical stream cipher encrypts plaintext one byte at a time, although a stream cipher may be designed to operate on one bit at a time, or on units larger than a byte at a time
- Processes the input elements continuously
- Produces output one element at a time
- Primary advantage is that they are almost always faster and use far less code
- For applications that require encryption/decryption of a stream of data, such as over a data communications channel or a browser/web link, a stream cipher might be a better alternative
- RC4 is the most widely used of all stream ciphers
- Developed in 1987 by Ron Rivest, one of the developers for public-key cipher RSA

### Block Cipher

Message divided into blocks (e.g. sets of 8- or 16-bit blocks) and each is transformed into encrypted block of cipher bits using algorithm and key
- A block cipher processes the input one block of elements at a time, producing an output block for each input block
- For applications that deal with blocks of data, such as file transfer, e-mail, database, block ciphers may be more appropriate
- E.g. of block ciphers: DES, 3DES, AES, RC5, Blowfish, etc.

### Encryption Modes

Different encryption modes may be used. Common modes include:
- Electronic Code Book (ECB): Each block encrypted separately
- Cipher Block Chaining (CBC): Next input depends on previous output

## Cryptosystem

Cryptosystem (or Cryptographic system) is the package of all procedures, protocols, cryptographic algorithms, and instructions used for enciphering and deciphering messages with cryptography

### Choosing Algorithms

The algorithm chosen depends on the application
- Encrypting streams of data in real-time has different requirements than encryption files on your local computer
- Symmetric: Best for data on your hard drive
- Asymmetric: Good for messages

## Aims of Cryptography

Cryptography is used to achieve information
- Confidentiality: Only authorised persons can access information
- Integrity: Information that was sent is what was received
- Authentication: Guarantee of originator and of electronic transmission (using digital signature)
- Non-repudiation: Originator of information cannot deny content or transmission (using digital signature)

# Shift/Caesar Cipher

![Caesar Cipher](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Caesar_cipher_left_shift_of_3.svg/1200px-Caesar_cipher_left_shift_of_3.svg.png)

Caesar's cipher uses an algorithm and a key
- The algorithm specifies that you offset the alphabet either to the right (forward) or the left (backwards)
- The key specifies how far the offset is

Caesar's cipher is also known as the **shift cipher**

An example of Caesar's cipher: 
```
LPHKWYBLA becomes SWORDFISH with a key of 7
```

# Substitution Cipher

Simple shift ciphers are easy to crack, by figuring out the number of rotations

Substitution ciphers were developed afterwards because they are more complex. Substitution ciphers work on the principle of substituting a different letter for every letter
- a becomes g, b becomes d etc.
- The letters are not in order as tehy are in shift ciphers

Basic idea: Substitute each block of plaintext by a different block

If plaintext is in english, then
- Mono-alphabetic substitution (one to one relationship)
- Poly-alphabetic substitution (one to many relationship)

In substitution ciphers, alphabets may be shifted, reversed, or scrambled
- Shift: Creating the caesar cipher
- Reversed: Creating Atbash cipher (simple substitution cipher for the Hebrew alphabet)
- Scrambled: Creating a mixed alphabet or deranged alphabet

Traditionally, mixed alphabets may be created by first writing out a keyword, removing repeated letters in it, then writing all the remaining letters in the alphabet in the usual order
- Example: The keyword **ZEBRAS** gives the following alphabet

| Plaintext                  | Ciphertext                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ | **ZEBRAS**CDFGHIJKLMNOPQTUVWXY |

This converts the message: `FLEE AT ONCE. WE ARE DISCOVERED!` into `SIAA ZQ LKBA. VA ZOA RFPBLUAOAR!`

# Transposition Cipher

The order of letters are changed. This can be done at the bit level or at the byte level - transposition ciphers move these bits or bytes to another location in the block, so that bit 1 becomes bit 4, bit 2 becomes bit 7 etc.

For example, `THE UNEXAMINED LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING` written vertically over 6 columns becomes

```
TX SOV
HAL RI
EMINTN
 IFOHG
UNET
NE  L
EDIWI
```

Then, written horizontally, becomes

`TX SOVHAL RIEMINTN IFOHGUNET  NE  LEDIWI`

# Vigenere Cipher

The vigenere cipher is a much more complex cipher which corrects the issues with more simplistic keys. It is a poly-alphabetic substitution cipher that depends on a password
- Makes the algorithm simple
- But the key rather complex, with the best keys comprising very long and random data

A vigenere cipher is done by setting up a substitution table like this:

```
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A
C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B
D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C
E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D
...
...
Y Z A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X
Z A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y
```

- Password is matched up to the text it is meant to encipher
- The cipher letter is determined by the use of the grid
    - Match the plaintext character's row
    - With the password character's column
    - Resulting in a single ciphertext character where the 2 meet
- For example, Plaintext is `SEND HELP` and password is `CABINET`
    - 1st plaintext letter is `S`, 1st password letter is `C`
    - Ciphertext is now `U`

# Exclusive Or (XOR)

XOR is a function of boolean algebra - 2 bits are compared and the binary result is generated
- If 2 bits are identical (both 0 or both 1), result is binary 0
- If 2 bits are not identical, result is binary 1

XOR is very simple to implement and simple to break; should not be used by itself when organisation is transmitting/storing sensitive data

# One-Time Pads

A type of substitution cipher that is absolutely unbreakable
- One-time pad was invented in 1917 by Joesph Mauborgne and Gilbert Vernam and is also known as the Vernam Cipher

Cipher uses a block of shift keys ($k_1, k_2, ..., k_n$) to encrypt a plaintext $M$ of length $n$, with each shift key being chosen uniformly at random
- Since each shift is random, every cipher text is equally likely for any plaintext

In spite of their perfect security, one-time pads have their weaknesses
- The key has to be as long as the plaintext
- Keys can never be reused
    - Repeated use of one-time pads allowed the US to break some of the communications of the Soviet spies during the Cold War
- Such cipher is difficult to break, but not very practical

# Modern Cipher

- Operate on binary plaintext
- Use binary keys of fixed legnths
- DIfferent types of ciphers
    - Symmetric ciphers
        - Stream ciphers (RC4, A5/x, Helix, SEAL)
        - Block ciphers (DES, Triple-DES, Blowfish, AES)
    - Asymmetric ciphers
        - Diffie-Hellman, ElGamal, RSA, ECC
- 2 basic operations in a modern cipher are
    1. Substitution: Substitutes a code symbol for another
        - E.g. shifts (Vigenere cipher), xor
    2. Permutation: Transposes or re-orders the symbols present in the code
- Both steps are needed for security

## Symmetric Key Encryption

When a plaintext is encrypted into a ciphertext, and the ciphertext is decrypted back into plaintext, the **same key is used for both encryption and decryption**. This is a symmetric key encryption

Advantages
- Symmetric-key ciphers can be designed to have high rates of data throughput
- Some hardware and software implementations achieve encrypt rates of hundreds of megabytes per second
- Keys for symmetric key ciphers are relatively short
    - E.g. 128-bit keys are considered very safe

Disadvantages
- In a 2-party communication, the key must remain secret at both ends
- In a large network, there are many key pairs to be managed. Consequently, effective key management requires the use of a trusted third party

Popular symmetric encryption algorithms include
- DES
- 3DES
- AES
- Blowfish

### Data Encryption Standard (DES)

- In 1973, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) now National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requested proposals for national symmetric-key cryptosystem
- A proposal from IBM was accepted as DES and adopted in 1976-77
- DES once was the most popular symmetric encryption cryptosystems, also being the first crypto system to have been used in commercial applications
- DES is a block cipher with 64-bit block size and 56-bit key
- Since it is a symmetric-key algorithm, it employs the same key in both encryption and decryption
- DES was adopted by NIST in 1976 as federal standard for encrypting non-classified information
- However after awhile, NIST had to replace DES because 56-bit key lengths were too small considering the increased processing powers of newer computers
- DES's dominance came to an end in 2002, and NIST officially withdrew DES

### 3DES

Triple DES is a symmetric key-block cipoher which applies the DES cipher in triplicate
- It encrypts the first key (k1)
- Decrypts using the second key (k2)
- Encrypts with the third key (k3)

```
Plaintext -> Encrypt with K1 -> Decrypt with K2 -> Encrypt with K3 -> Ciphertext
```

A 2 key variant also exists, where k1 and k3 are the same key. Note that if k1 = k2 = k3, then it is similar to DES

### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Originally called Rijndael, the cipher was developed by 2 Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen

- AES uses a block size of 128 and key size varies according to the version
- 3 versions are known as AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256
- Although no efficient attacks exist against AES, in 2011, a trio of cryptography researchers working at microsoft and european universities identified a weakness in AES that can crack secret keys faster than before
- However, recovering a key is still very difficult. The number of steps required to crack AES-128 is roughly $8 \times 10^{37}$

## Public (Asymmetric) Key Cryptography

Symmetric algorithms are important because they are comparatively fast and have few computational requirements. However, their main weakness is that 2 geographically distant parties both need to have a key that matches the other key exactly. Secure key exchange becomes an issue.

Symmetric cryptography was well suited for organisations such as governments, military and big financial corporations which wanted to securely store the classified information. However, the symmetric key was found to be non-practical when 2 parties want to securely communicate. Thus this gave rise to the public cryptosystem

Public key (aka asymmetric key encryption)
- Uses 2 different but related keys
- Either key can encrypt or decrypt message
- If key A encrypts message, only key B can decrypt
- One key serves as a private key, the other serves as the public key

Public-key Cryptography (PKC) was invented by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976

Various public key algorithms include
- Diffie-Hellman
- El-Gamal
- RSA
- Elliptic Curve (Used in Bitcoin)

```
Plaintext -> Encryption algorithm with public key -> Ciphertext -> Decryption algorithm with private key -> Plaintext
```

If Bob wants to send a message to Alice, Bob will use Alice's public key to encrypt. Then, when Alice wants to read the message, she can only use her private key to decrypt the message.

If Bob uses his private key for encryption, only Bob's public key can decrypt the message. Alice knows the message is from Bob

### Prime Numbers and Mod

Primes are numbers with only divisors 1 and itself
- Cannot be written as a product of other numbers
- 2, 3, 5, 7 are primes

Mod: The remainder when a number is divided by another
- 15 mod 20 = 15
- 5 mod 3 = 2

### Public Key Algorithms

RSA Cryptosystem
- The first which provided a complete solution on
    - How to generate private and public key
    - How to encrypt and decrypt data
    - How to generate and verify digital signatures
- RSA remains the most employed cryptosystem even today
- The security of RSA is based on factorising large prime numbers
    - It is easy to calculate the product of 2 numbers, while it is extremely difficult to find the factor of 2 numbers, when the size is extremely large
    - This is called a one-way function, which means that it is easy to compute the function, but hard to compute its inverse (unless you know the secret (private key))

El-Gamal
- Designed by Taher Elgamal in 1985
    - Based on original ideas of Diffie and Hellman
    - Security based on assumed difficulty of discrete log
    - Consists of both encryption and signature algorithms
    - Cipher text is twice the size of the plaintext
    - Slow

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
- Neal Koblitz and Victor Miller proposed using elliptic curves for cryptography in 1985, however it only saw wide use from 2005
- Majority of public-key crypto uses large numbers and imposes a significant load in storing and processing keys and messages
- ECC on the other hand uses elliptic curves and offers the same security with smaller bit sizes
- Even though RSA is widely used, in recent times ECC is becoming more popular, particularly after its use in crypto currencies

# Public Key + Symmetric

Problem: Public key systems are powerful but slow, while symmetric systems are inflexible but fast. 

Hence, we can use a hybrid system instead
- Sender generates a random symmetric session key
- Sender encrypts session key using receivers' public key
- Receiver decrypts it using his/her private key and now both have the shared sesion key

Result: A fast, flexible system

The hybrid scheme combines the advantages of symmetric and asymmetric ciphers
- Throughput of symmetric cipher
- Key management of asymmetric cipher

A 2 staged approach is used
- In the first step, public key cryptography is used to derive a session key
- Subsequently, the sesion key is used to encrypt the actual message

# Digital Signature

A digital signature (digital thumbprint) is a message digest used to cryptographically sign a message
- Digital signatures rely on asymmetric (public key) cryptography
- To create a digital signature, you sign the message with your private key. The digital signature then becomes part of your message
- This has 2 effects
    - Any changes to the message can be detected, due to the message digest algorithm
    - You cannot deny signing the message, because it was signed with your private key
- These 2 features, message integrity and non-repudiation, make digital signatures a very useful component for e-commerce applications
- Digital signatures can be used in all electronic communications
- It is an electronic stamp or seal that is appended to the document
- Ensures that the document remains unchanged during the transmission

# Key Size

- When deploying ciphers, key size is important
- The strength of many encryption applications and systems is measured by key size
- For cryptosystems, the security of encrypted data is not dependent on keeping the encrypting algorithm secret
- Cryptosystem security depends on keeping some or all of elements of the key secret
- There are 2 keys
    - Public and Private keys: These keys are used to exchange the symmetric key. For RSA, a key size of 2048 (2K) is considered safe
    - Session key: A secret key (symmetric key) which is used during the communication between client and server. A key size of 128 or more is considered very reasonable. A key size of 256 is considered very safe and secure, however it will be slower than the algorithm with key size 128. The key size also depends on the actual algorithm, as some algorithms use fixed key sizes, while others like AES have different key sizes for different versions

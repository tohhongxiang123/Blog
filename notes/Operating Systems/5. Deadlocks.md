# Deadlocks

A deadlock is a set of blocked processes each holding a resource and waiting to acquire a resource held by another process in the set

For example, consider the following 2 processes P0 and P1, with semaphores A and B

P0: 

```
wait(A);
wait(B);
// do something
signal(B);
signal(A);
```

P1:

```
wait(B);
wait(A);
// do something else
signal(A);
signal(B);
```

Consider the following sequence of events taking place

1. P0 starts first, and executes `wait(A)` successfully
2. Context switch occurs to P1, and `wait(B)` successfully executes
3. Context switch occurs and P0 is now currently waiting on `B`. However, P1 is currently holding semaphore `B` and is waiting for `A`, while P0 is holding `A` and is waiting for `B`. Both processes are waiting for each other to complete before they can continue. This is a deadlock.

# System Model

- Consider resource types $R_1, R_2, ..., R_m$
    - Memory space, IO devices, semaphores etc
- Each resource type $R_i$ has $W_i$ identical instances
- Each process utilises a resource as follows:
    1. Request for a specific number of instances
    2. Use the instances
    3. Release all the instances

## Resource Allocation Graph

Consider the graph $G = (V, E)$

- $V$ is partitioned into 2 types
    1. $P = \{P_1, P_2, ..., P_n\}$, the set consisting of all the processes in the system
    2. $R = \{R_1, R_2, ..., R_m\}$, the set consisting of all resource types in the system
- $E$ is partitioned into 2 types 
    1. Request edge: Directed edge $P_i \to R_j$
        - This edge is added when a process $P_i$ requests for resource $R_j$
        - When the request is granted, this edge is removed
    2. Assignment edge: Directed edge $R_j \to P_i$
        - This edge is added when a resource $R_j$ is assigned to $P_i$
        - When the resource is released, this edge is removed

### Resource Allocation Graph without Deadlock

Over here, we can see that $P_1$ and $P_2$ have to complete execution first, since they are using $R_1$ and $R_2$ respectively. Only once both of them complete, $P_3$ can continue execution, and finish.

### Resource Allocation Graph with Deadlock

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Slide1.jpg)

Over here, $P_1$ is currently using $R_1$ and is waiting for $R_2$, while $P_2$ is currently using $R_2$ and is waiting for $R_1$. For $P_1$ to continue execution, $P_2$ must release $R_2$ first. However, for $P_2$ to continue exeuction, $P_1$ must release $R_1$ first. 

Since both of the processes are waiting upon each other, and no progress can be made, this is a deadlock.

Note that, not all graphs with cycles means that there is a deadlock. Consider the following resource allocation graph below:

If $P_3$ finishes execution, $P_2$ can execute, and then finally $P_1$.

## Basic Facts

- If graph contains no cycles -> No deadlock
- If graph contains a cycle
    - If only one instance per resource type, then deadlock
    - If several instances per resource type, then possiblity of deadlock

# Deadlock Conditions

Deadlock may arise if the following 4 conditions hold simultaneously
1. Mutual Exclusion: Only 1 process at a time can use a resource instance
2. Hold and wait: A process holding at least one resouce is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes
3. No preemption: A resource can be released only voluntarily by the process holding it, after that process has completed its task
4. Circular wait: There exists a set $\{P_0, P_1, ..., P_n\}$ of waiting processes such that $P_0$ is waiting for a resource that is held by $P_1$, $P_1$ is waiting for a resouce held by $P_2$, ..., $P_{n-1}$ is waiting for a resource held by $P_n$, and $P_n$ is waiting for a resource held by $P_1$.

# Handling Deadlocks

There are multiple ways to handle deadlock
- Ensure that system will never enter a deadlock state
- Allow the system to enter a deadlock state and then recover
- Ignore the problem and pretend that deadlocks never occur in the system
    - Used by most operating systems, including UNIX
  
## Deadlock Prevention

To prevent deadlocks, we must prevent at least 1 of the 4 deadlock conditions

Recall the dining-philosopher solution using semaphores
- Each chopstick is a shared resourdce protected by a binary semaphore (`chopstick[5]`)
- Initially for all i, `chopstick[i] = 1`
- For each philosopher

```c
while (1) {
    wait(chopstick[i]);
    wait(chopstick[(i + 1) % 5]);

    eat();

    signal(chopstick[i]);
    signal(chopstick[(i + 1) % 5]);

    think();
}
```

1. Mutual exclusion
    - Chopsticks are not shareable simultaneously, hence this condition cannot be eliminated
2. Hold and wait
    - Must guarantee that whenever a process requests a resource, it does not hold up any other resource
    - Allow a philosopher to pick up chopsticks only if both the required chopsticks are available
3. No preemption
    - If a philosopher cannot get the second chopstick, then preempt and release the chopstick that is being held
4. Circular wait
    - Allow at most 4 philosophers to be hungry simultaneously
    - Odd-even solution
    - Chopsticks can only be acquired in order

## Deadlock Avoidance

The deadlock-avoidance algorithm dynamically examines the resource-allocation state to ensure that the system never goes into an unsafe state
- When a proces requests an available resource, the system must decide if immediate allocation leaves the system in a "safe" state
- If safe, the request is granted, else, the process must wait

System is in safe stae if **there exists a safe completion sequence of all processes without deadlock**

### Safe State

A process completion sequence $<P_1, P_2, ..., P_n>$ is safe, if for each $P_i$, the resources that $P_i$ requests can be satisfied by currently available resources + resources held by all the $P_j, j < i$

- If $P_i$'s needs cannot be immediately met, then $P_i$ can wait until all $P_j, j < i$ have finished
- When all $P_j, j < i$ are finished, $P_i$ can obtain needed resources, execute, return allocated resources, and terminate
- When $P_i$ terminates, $P_{i+1}$ can obtain its resources, and so on
- All processes in the sequence can finish

For example,

| Process | Hold | Request |
| ------- | ---- | ------- |
| 1       | 1    | 1       |
| 2       | 1    | 2       |
| 3       | 1    | 3       |

Is `<P1, P2, P3>` safe?

- P1.request: available
- P2.request: P1.hold + available
- P3.request: P1.hold + P2.hold + available

Since all the processes can complete, it is safe

Is `<P3, P2, P1>` safe?

- P3.request: available
- P2.request: P3.hold + available
- P1.request: P3.hold + P2.hold + ???

Hence, this is not a safe state

# Propositional Logic

Syntax
- Symbols to use
- Rules of symbol composition into sentences

Semantics (Intepretation)
- Provide meaning to symbols
- Meaning construction (as a function of sentence structure)

Inference (Reasoning) Rules
- Preferably sound and complete

E.g.
- Anil is intelligent (proposition)
- Anil is hardworking (proposition)
- If Anil is hardworking and Anil is intelligent, then Anil scores a high mark (proposition)

# Elements of Propositional Logic

- Symbols
    - Logical constants: True, False
    - Propositional symbols, $P$, $Q$
    - Logical connectives, $\land$, $\lor$, $\iff$ etc.
    - Parentheses $()$
- Sentences
    - Atomic sentences: Constants, propositional sumbols
    - Combined with connectives, e.g. $P \land Q \lor R$
    - Also wrapped in parentheses , e.g. $(P \land Q) \lor R$

# Logical Connective

- Conjunction
    - Binary operation $P \land Q$, "P and Q", where $P$, $Q$ are the conjuncts
- Disjunction
    - Binary operation $P \lor Q$, "P or Q", where $P$, $Q$ are disjuncts
- Implication
    - Binary operation $P \implies Q$, "P implies Q", where $P$ is the premise, and $Q$ is the conclusion
    - Conditionals, "if-then" statements, or rules
- Equivalencde
    - Binary operation, $P \iff Q$, "P equivalent to Q"
    - Biconditional
- Negation
    - Unary operation $\neg P$, or "not P"

# Syntax of Propositional Logic

- Sentence: AtomicSentence | ComplexSentence
- AtomicSentence: LogicalConstant | PropositionalSymbol
- ComplexSentence: (Sentence) | Sentence LogicalConnective Sentence | $\neg$ Sentence
- LogicalConstant: TRUE | FALSE
- PropositionalSymbol: $P | Q | R | ...$
- LogicalConnective: $\land$ | $\lor$ | $\implies$ | $\neg$ | $\iff$

Note the precedence from highest to lowest:
1. $\neg$
2. $\land$
3. $\lor$
4. $\implies$
5. $\iff$

# Truth Table

| $P$ | $Q$ | $\neg P$ | $P \land Q$ | $P \lor Q$ | $P \implies Q$ | $P \iff Q$ |
| --- | --- | -------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| F   | F   | T        | F           | F          | T              | T          |
| F   | T   | T        | F           | T          | T              | F          |
| T   | F   | F        | F           | T          | F              | F          |
| T   | T   | F        | T           | T          | T              | T          |

# Semantics of Propositional Logic

- Intepretation of symbols
    - Logical constants have fixed meaning
        - True: Always means the fact is the case; valid
        - False: Always means that the fact is not the case; unsatisfiable
    - Propositional symbols mean "whatever they mean"
        - E.g. $P$ "we are in a pit" etc.
        - Satisfiable, but not valid (true only when the fact is the case)
- Intepretation of sentences
    - Meaning derived from the meaning of its parts
        - Sentence is a combination of sentences with connectives
    - Logical connectives as boolean functions
        - TruthValue f(TruthValue, TruthValue)

# Validity

- A sentence is valid if it is true in **all** models
- Valid sentences are known as tautologies
    - Necessarily true, or vacuously true
- Every valid sentence is logically equivalent to true

# Satisfiability

- A sentence is satisfiable if it is true in some models
- Satisfiability can be checked by enumerating the possible models until one is found that satisfies the sentence
- Most problems in computer science are satisfiability problems
    - E.g. constraint satisfaction, search problems

# Testing for Validity and Satisfiability

- Testing for validity
    - Using truth tables, checking all possible configurations

# Logical Equivalents

- 2 sentences are logically equivalent if they are true in the same set of model
- $A \implies B \equiv \neg A \lor B$
- $\neg(A \lor B) \equiv \neg A \land \neg B$
- $\neg(A \land B) \equiv \neg A \lor \neg B$

# Entailment

- The relation of logical entailment between sentences: A sentence follows logically from another sentence
- $A \models B$
- $A$ entails the sentence $B$
- If $A$ is true, then $B$ must be true
- In models where $A$ is true, then $B$ is true

# Inference

$$
KB \models A
$$

- KB is a knowledge base consisting of a set of sentences expressed in a knowledge representation language

# Rules of Inference

- Implication-Elimination, or Modus Ponens
    - If $A \implies B$ and $A$, then $B$
- And-Elimination
    - If $A_1 \land A_2 \land ... \land A_n$, then $A_i$
- And-Introduction
    - If $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$, then $A_1 \land A_2 \land ... \land A_n$
- Or-Introduction
    - If $A_i$, then $A_1 \lor A_2 \lor ... \lor A_n$
- Double-negation Elimination
    - If $\neg \neg A$, then $A$

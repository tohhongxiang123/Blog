# Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

- An agent senses an environment
- With internal knowledge from the agent + what the agent sense from the environment, the agent performs an action
- This action changes the environment

# From Search to Logical Reasoning

- Representation of knowledge, and reasoning processes are central to AI
- A knowledge-based system (KBS) is a computer program that reasons and uses a knowledge base to solve complex problems

# Knowledge Based Approach

- Agent that knows
    - Achieve competence by being told new knowledge or by learning
    - Achieve adaptability by updating their knowledge
    - Knowledge representation
- Agent that reasons
    - Use knowledge to deduce course of actions
    - Inference mechanism

# Knowledge Based Agent

- Knowledge base (KB)
    - Set of sentences
    - Knowledge representation language
- Adding and querying knowledge
    - Tell: Add a sentence to the KB
    - Ask: Retrieve knowledge from the KB
- Inference mechanism
    - Role: Determine what follows from the KB

# Problem Formulation of KBS

- Knowledge based systems
    - States: Instance of the KB (sets of sentences)
        - Use "Tell" to build the KB
        - E.g. Tell(KB, "Smoke -> Fire")
        - Tell(KB, "Fire -> Call 911")
    - Operators: Add/infer a new sentence
    - Goal: Answer a query
        - Use "Ask" to query the KB
        - E.g. Ask(KB, "? -> Call 911")

# Knowledge Representation 

- Knowledge representation (KR)
    - KB: Set of sentences -> need to
    - Express knowledge in a computer-tractable form
- Knowledge representation language
    - Syntax: Implementation level
        - Possible configurations that constitute sentences
    - Semantics: Knowledge level
        - Facts of the world the sentences refer to
        - E.g. language of arithmetics: x, y, numbers. Sentences such as x >= y
    - Logic: Representation + Inference = Logic
        - Where representation = syntax + semantics
    - Reasoning
        - Construction of new sentences from existing ones
    - Entailment as logical inference

# Entailment and Inference

Entailment
- Generate sentences that are necessarily true, given that the existing sentences are true
- Notation: KB |= a
- E.g. { x >= y, y >= z } |= x >= z

Inference
- Tell, given KB: (KB |= a)
- Ask, given KB and a: (KB |= a)?
- Can be described by the sentences it derives, KB |= ai

Soundness
- Generate only entailed sentences
- Proof: Sequence of operations of a sound inference
- Record of operations that generate a specific entailed sentence
- E.g. Smoke -> Fire and Smoke |= Fire. Fire -> Call 911 and Fire |= Call

Completeness
- A proof can be found for any entailed sentence

Proof theory
- Specify the reasoning operations that are sound

Definition
- Inference (reasoning) is the process by which conclusions are reached
- Logical inference (deduction) is the process that implements entailment between sentences

Useful properties
- Valid sentence (tautology)
    - iff TRUE under all possible intepretations in all possible worlds
    - E.g. S or NOT S is always true
- Satisfiable sentence
    - iff there is some intepretationin some world for which it is TRUE
    - E.g. S and NOT S is unsatisfiable

An example of sound inference
- Sentence: x
    - Semantics: An expression: can be a single symbol/number, concatenation of 2 expressions, etc
- Sentence: x y
    - Semantics: An expression which refers to  a quantity that is the product of the quantities referred to by each of the expressions
- Sentence: x = y
    - Semantics: The 2 expressions on each side of "=" refer to the same quantity
- A sound inference:
    - (E = mc^2, T1 >= T2) |= (E T1 >= mc^2 T2)

Intepretation (meaning)
- Correspondence between sentences and facts
- Arbitrary meaning, fixed by the writer of the sentence
    - E.g. natural language, meaning fixed by usage (dictionary)
    - Exceptions: encrypted messages, codes 
- Systemic relationship: Compositional languages
    - The meaning of a sentence is a function of the meaning of its parts
- Truth value
    - A sentence makes a claim about the world -> TRUE or FALSE
    - Depends on the interpretation of the state of the world

Formal logic
- Syntax: A set of rules for writing sentences
- Semantics: A set of rules (constraints) for relating sentences to facts
- Proof theory/inference procedure: A set of rules for deducing entailment of sentences

Propositional logic
- Symbols, representing propositions (facts)
- Boolean connectives, combining symbols
    - E.g. Hot AND Humid

First order logic
- Object and predicates, representing properties of and relations between objects
- Variables, boolean connectives and quantifiers
    - E.g. "hot(x)", "hot(air)" or "hot(air) and humid(air)"

Temporal logic
- World ordered by a set of time points (intervals)

Probabilistic and fuzzy logic
- Degrees of belief and truth in sentences
    - "Washington is a state" with belief degree 0.4, "a city" 0.6
    - "Washington is a large city" with truth degree 0.6

# Commitments of Logics

| Formal (KR) Language | Ontological commitment (what exists in the world) | Epistemological commitment (what an agent believes about facts) |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Propositional logic  | facts                                             | True/False/Unknown                                              |
| First-order logic    | facts, objects, relations                         | True/False/Unknown                                              |
| Temporal logic       | Facts, objects, relations, times                  | True/False/Unknown                                              |
| Probability logic    | Facts                                             | Degree of belief (0 .. 1)                                       |
| Fuzzy logic          | Degrees of truth 0 .. 1                           | Degree of belief 0 .. 1                                         |

# Propositional Logic

- P: It rains on Tuesday
- Q: John like chocolate

P and Q are either TRUE or FALSE

# First Order Logic

- If x is a man, then x is a mortal
    - man(x) -> mortal(x)
    - not man(x) or mortal(x)
- If n is a natural number, then n is either even or odd
    - Natural(n) -> even(n) or odd(n)

# Fuzzy Logic

Sets with fuzzy boundaries
- Instead of a boolean TRUE/FALSE, the "trueness" of an expression is within a range from [0,1]

# Non-Monotonic Logic

- Defeasible inference
    - Conclusions are retracted with KB changes
- Capable of dealing with inconsistent KBs
    - E.g. contradictions and exemptions
    - Birds commonly fly, penguins are birds, but penguins do not fly

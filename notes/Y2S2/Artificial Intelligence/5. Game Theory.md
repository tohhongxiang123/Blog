# Game Theory

- Game theory studies settings where multiple parties each have
  - Different preferences
  - Different actions they can take
- Each agent's utility depends on all agents' actions
  - What is optimal for one agent depends on what the other agents do
- Game theory suggests how agents can rationally form beliefs over what other agents will do, and hence how agents should act
  - Useful for acting as well as predicting behaviors of others

# Nash Equilibrium

- Nash equilibrium is a concept where the optimal outcome of a game is one where no player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy after considering an opponent's choice
- Each agent is selfish
- Each agent makes decisions based on what he thinks otherse would do
- No one can do better by changing strategy solely
- Any game with finite actions must have a nash equilibrium

# Prisoner's Dilemma

Prisoner A and B are in prison. They can make the following actions: Confess, or remain silent

- If both A and B confess, they will get 5 years in prison
- If A confesses, while the B remains silent, then A gets 0 years in prison, while B gets 20 years in prison (and vice versa)
- If both A and B remain silent, they will get only 1 year in prison

| (A, B)  | Confess | Silent |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| Confess | 5, 5    | 0, 20  |
| Silent  | 20, 0   | 1, 1   |

Let us take the perspective of A

- If B confesses, then it is better if we confess (5 vs 20)
- If B remains silent, then it is better if we confess (0 vs 1)

Similarly for B, if A confesses, it is better to confess. And if A remains silent, it is better if we confess.

Even though it would be better for A and B to cooperate, rationally, it is better for A and B to both confess

# First Order Logic

We extend propositional logic to represent
- Membership in a set
    - Dog(X) means "X is a dog"
- Consequence of membership (quanitifiers)
    - $\forall X Dog(X) \implies Loyal(X)$: For all X, if X is a dog, X is loyal
- General relationships (predicates)
    - Father(Z, J): Z is the father of J
- Functions
    - Loyal(DogOf(J)): J's dog is loyal

# Knowledge Representation + Reasoning

- Syntax
    - Symbols to use
    - Rules of symbol composition into sentences
- Semantics (Intepretation)
    - Provide meaning to symbols
    - Meaning construction (as a function of sentence structure)
- Inference (Reasoning) Rules
    - Preferably sound and complete

# Syntax of FOL

- Sentences
    - Built from quantifiers, predicate symbols and terms
- Terms 
    - Represent objects
    - Built from variables, constants and function symbols
- Constant symbols
    - Refer to ("name") particular objects of the world
        - E.g. "John" refers to a particular person, is a constant
        - John, king of England, brother of Richard

## Terms: Constants and Variables

- A constant of type $W$ is a name that denotes a particular object in a set $W$
    - E.g. 5, Tommy, etc.
- A variable of type $W$ is a name that can denote any elements in the set $W$
    - E.g. $x \in N$ denotes a natural number

## Terms: Functions

A functional term of arity $n$ takes $n$ objects of type $W_1, W_2, ..., W_n$ as inputs, returning an object of type $W$
- E.g. Plus(3,4) = 7, Plus(Plus(2, 3), Plus(6, 9))

## Sentences: Predicates

- Predicates are like functions except that their return type is true or false
    - Example: Gt(x, y) is true if x > y
    - Gt is a predicate symbol which takes in 2 arguments, which are natural numbers
    - Gt(3,4) is a valid predicate, Gt(3, -4) is not (-4 is not natural number)
- A predicate with no variable is a proposition
    - E.g. Tommy is a dog
- E.g. of predicates:
    - Dog(x) is true iff x is a dog
    - Mortal(y) is true iff y is a mortal

# Sentences of FOL

- Atomic sentences
    - State facts, using terms and predicate symbols
        - E.g. Brother(Richard, Jon)
    - Can have complex terms as arguments
        - E.g. Married(FatherOf(Richard), MotherOf(Jon))
    - Have a truth value, which depends on both the interpretation and the world
- Complex sentences
    - Combine sentences with connectives
        - E.g. Father(Henry, KingJohn) AND Mother(Mary, KingJohn)
    - Connectives identical to propositional logic (AND, OR, IFF, etc)

## Express Properties of Collections of Objects

- Make a statement about every object without enumerating using forall $\forall$
    - E.g. All kings are mortal
    - Instead of: King(Henry) -> Mortal(Henry) ^ King(John) -> Mortal(John) ...
    - We can use the $\forall$ quantifier: $\forall x, King(x) \implies Mortal(x)$

- Express properties of some particular objects with the existential quanitifer $\exists$
    - E.g. King John has a brother who is a king
    - Instead of: (Brother(Henry, KingJohn) ^ King(Henry)) v (Brother(Mary, KingJohn) ^ King(Mary)) v ...
    - $\exists x, Brother(x, KingJohn) \land King(x)$

### Combining $\forall$ and $\exists$

- Express more complex sentences
    - If x is the parent of y, then y is the child of x
    - $\forall x \forall y Parent(x, y) \implies Child(y, x)$
    - Every person has a parent
- Semantics depends on quantifiers ordering
    - $\exists y, \forall x, Parent(y, x)$
    - There exists a person who is everybody's parent

### Connections Between Quantifiers

- Equivalences
    - Using the negation (hence only 1 quantifier is needed)
    - $\forall x P(x) \iff \neg \exists x \neg P(x)$
    - E.g. everyone is mortal: $\forall x Mortal(x) \iff \neg \exists x \neg Mortal(x)$

# Inference of FOL

- Syntax:
    - Constants: John, Richard
    - Functions: Father
    - Predicates: King/1, Greedy/1, Evil/1
- KB: $\forall x King(x) \land Greedy(x) \implies Evil(x)$
- We want to conclude:
    - $King(John) \land Greedy(John) \implies Evil(John)$
    - $King(Richard) \land Greedy(Richard) \implies Evil(Richard)$
    - $King(Father(John)) \land Greedy(Father(John)) \implies Evil(Father(John))$

## Substitution

- A substitution is a finite set of the form $\{ V_1/t_1, ..., V_k/t_k \}$ where each $V_i$ is a distinct vairable, and each $t_i$ is a term. The element $V_i/t_i$ is a binding for variable $V_i$.
- E.g. 
    - $p(a, X) \{X/c\} = p(a, c)$
    - $p(X,X,Y,Y,Z))\{X/Z,Y/t\}=p(Z,Z,t,t,Z)$


## Universal Instantiation

$$
\forall x P(x) \\
\therefore P(c)
$$

- Given a universal generalisation (an $\forall$ sentence), the rule allows you to infer any instance of that generalisation

"No humans can fly. John Doe is human. Therefore John Doe can not fly."
- $F(x)$: x can fly
- $H(x)$: x is human
- $d$ is a symbol that represents John Doe

1. $\forall x [H(x) \implies \neg F(x)]$ (Hypothesis)
2. $H(d)$ (Hypothesis)
3. $H(d) \implies \neg F(d)$ (Universal instantiation of 1)
4. $\neg F(d)$ (Modus ponens on 2 and 3)

## Existential Instantiation

$$
\exist x P(x) \\
\therefore P(c)
$$

where $c$ is some element of the universe of discourse. It is not arbitrary, but must be one for which $P(c)$ is true. $c$ MUST BE a new name or constant symbol (skolem constant)

"If you score a 95 in your final exam, you will get an A. Somebody scored 95 in the final exam. This means that someone got an A"

- Let the universe be the set of all people in the world, let N(x) mean that x gets 95 on the final exam of CS398, and let A(x) represent that x gets an A for CS398.
- Let $N(x)$: x gets 95 on the final exam of CS398
- Let $A(x)$: x gets A for CS398

1. $\forall x [N(x) \implies A(x)]$ (For everybody, if they get 95 for their finals, they get an A for their course grade)
2. $\exist x N(x)$ (There is somebody who got 95 for their finals)
3. $N(c)$ (Existential instantiation for 2) (There exists some person $c$ who got 95 for finals)
4. $N(c) \implies A(c)$ (Universal instantiation on 1)
5. $A(c)$ (Modus ponens on 3 and 4)

## Unification and Lifting

- A substitution $\sigma$ is a unifier of expressions $e_1$ and $e_2$ if $e_1 \sigma \equiv e_2 \sigma$
    - E.g. $\sigma = \{X/a,Y/b\}$ is a unifier of $t(a,Y,c)$ and $t(X,b,c)$ as
    $t(a,Y,c)\{X/a,Y/b\}=t(X,b,c)\{X/a,Y/b\}=t(a,b,c)$
- A unifier is defined as: $Unify(p, q) = \sigma, s.t. Subst(\sigma, p) = Subst(\sigma, q)$
    - Unifiers are not unique, there can be more than one unifier
    - Unifier $\sigma$ is more general than unifier $\sigma'$ if it places fewer restrictions on variables
        - The most general unifier (MGU) is unique
    - MGU is found by recursion over the sentence structure
        - Does not exist if structures do not match
        - Variable $X$ cannot be replaced by expression with $X$ inside

- Generalised (Lifted) Modus Ponens
    - For atomic sentences $p_i', p_i, q$ and a substitution $\sigma$ such that $Subst(\sigma, p_i') = Subst(\sigma, p_i)$ for all $i$, then
    - $$
        p_1', ..., p_k', (p_1 \land p_2 \land ... \land p_k) \implies q \\
        Subst(\sigma, q)
        $$

    - Consider the following KB:
        - $\forall x King(x) \land Greedy(x) \implies Evil(x)$
        - $King(John)$
        - $\forall y Greedy(y)$
    - We want to infer if $Evil(John)$
    - $p_1' = King(John), p_2' = Greedy(y), p_1 = King(x), p_2 = Greedy(x), \sigma = \{x/John, y/John\}, q = Evil(x)$
    - Hence $SUBST(\sigma, q)$ is $Evil(John)$

# Skolemisation

- Given an expression; obtain its Conjunctive Normal Form
    - An implicative form is $A \implies B$ or $A \land B \implies C$
    - This is equivalent to the conjunctive normal form $\neg A \lor B$ or $\neg A \lor \neg B \lor C$

## Skolemisation Procedure

1. Eliminate implications: No such operation in CNF
2. Move $\neg$ inwards
    - Simplify quantifier use and expression structure
3. Standardise variables
    - No semantic confusion
4. Skolemise (existential quantifier elimination)
    - Named examples, $\exists$ is not part of CNF
5. Drop universal quantifiers
6. Distribute $\lor$ over $\land$

For example, consider the following expression:
$$
\forall x [\forall y Animal(y) \implies Loves(x, y)] \implies [\exists y Loves(y,x)]
$$

1. Eliminate implications: 
    $$
    \forall x  \neg [\forall y \neg Animal(y) \lor Loves(x, y)] \lor [\exists y Loves(y,x)]
    $$
2. Move negation inwards
    $$
    \forall x  [\exists y Animal(y) \land \neg Loves(x, y)] \lor [\exists y Loves(y,x)]
    $$
3. Standardise variables
    $$
    \forall x  [\exists y Animal(y) \land \neg Loves(x, y)] \lor [\exists z Loves(z,x)]
    $$
4. Skolemise (Existential quantifier elimination) ($\{ y/F(x), z/G(x) \}$)
    $$
    \forall x  [Animal(F(x)) \land \neg Loves(x, F(x))] \lor [Loves(G(x),x)]
    $$
5. Drop universal quantifiers
    $$
    [Animal(F(x)) \land \neg Loves(x, F(x))] \lor [Loves(G(x),x)]
    $$
6. Distribute $\lor$ over $\land$
    $$
    [Animal(F(x)) \lor Loves(G(x),x)] \land \\ [\neg Loves(x, F(x)) \lor Loves(G(x),x)]
    $$

# Resolution in FOL

- Given 2 clauses
    - $l_1 \lor \cdots \lor l_k$
    - $m_1 \lor \cdots \lor m_n$
- Let there be indices $i, j$ and substitution $\sigma$ such that $\sigma = Unify(l_i, \neg m_j)$
- Then we can resolve the following:

$$
l_1 \lor \cdots \lor l_k, m_1 \lor \cdots \lor m_n \\
Subst(\sigma, l_1 \lor \cdots \lor l_{i-1} \lor l_{i+1} \lor l_k \lor m_1 \lor \cdots \lor m_{j-1} \lor m_{j+1} \lor m_n)
$$

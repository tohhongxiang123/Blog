# Data Path and Control Design

# Basic Datapath Components

Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)
- ALU is the CPU's data processing or execution unit implements fixed point operations
- Floating point and complex numerical function are performed by arithmetic co-processors
- Typical arithmetic functions: Add, subtract, multiply divide
- Logic function: AND, OR, XOR, NOT
- Other data manipulation functions: Arithmetic and logical shift, incrementing and decrementing operands etc.

## ALU

- $n$-bit ALU can be made by placing $n$-1-bit ALU slices parallel
- The function select (F0, ..., Fn) for each 1-bit ALU is driven by instruction being executed

## Register File

![Register File](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ramin-Rajaei/publication/305708980/figure/fig4/AS:403289347772422@1473163082013/Structure-of-Proposed-Register-File.png)

- A register file is a collection of registers in which any register can be read or written by specifying the address. They form temporary storage inside the CPU
- General Purpose Register (GPR)
    - Contains 32 64-bit registers
    - Contains 2 read ports and 1 write port
- Basic Building blocks
    - Two 32:1 Multiplexer
    - One 5 to 32 Decoder
    - Register using Flipflop

### Building Blocks of Register File

Multiplexer:
- 32:1 MUX in MIPS register file
- Selects 1 input out of the 32 input lines to use

Decoder:
- 5:32 decoder
- Converts a 5 bit input into a 32 bit output
- Output of decoder used with RegWrite (Register Write) signal of a register file, to write to the corresponding register file

Register:
- A register is made up of multiple D-flipflops, so that it can hold multi-bit information, such as bytes or words

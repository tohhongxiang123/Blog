# Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

An ISA is a set of following specifications which a programmer must know to write a correct and efficient program for a specific machine. An ISA defines the supported instructions, datta types, registers and hardware support for managing main memory, fundamental features (such as memory consistency, addressing modes, and virtual memory), and the input/output model of a family of implementations of the ISA

- Instruction format
- Length of instruction and size of field
- Word size: 16, 32, 64 bit
- Set of all operations: Opcodes / machine language
- Register file specification: Size, width, and its usage of registers in the CPU
- Memory address space and addressability: Number of addressable locations, and bits per location
- Addressing modes: Ways of specifying and accessing operands, indicates how an address (memory or register) is intepreted and determined
- Operand locations: all in register, registers and memory or all in memory

# ARMv8 ISA (Specifically LEGv8)

ARM (Advanced RISC machine)

- Simple, sensible, regular, widely used RISC architecture
- Reduced Instruction set architecture (RISC) is widely used for its simpler implementation, easier pipelining, and superscalar computing
  - DEC alpha, PowerPC (Mac, IBM servers) etc
  - ARM processors (smartphones and embedded systems)
    - iPhone 5S uses a 64-bit apple A7 processor. The A7 includes an Apple designed ARMv8 dual-core CPU called Cyclone
  - Chips made from Intel, AMD etc
- 2 major revisions of ARM at present: ARMv7 for 32bit addresses, and ARMv8 for 64 bit address

## Specifications for ARMv8

- 64 bit address bus
- 64 bit data
- 32 bit instruction
- The size of a register in LEGv8 architecture is 64 bits; groups of 64 bits (8 bytes- doubleword)
  - A double word (dword) is a single unit of data expressing two adjacent words (a word is a standard unit of data for a certain processor architecture)
  - A word is a fixed-sized piece of data handled as a unit by the instruction set or the hardware of the processor
- 32 register files, with each register storing a 64 bit data
  - A register file is an array of processor registers in a central processing unit

### Register specification

CPU registers are used for frequently accessed data

General purpose register (GPR) file

- Contains 32 registers, each register is 64 bits
- Contains 2 read ports and 1 write port

Note that

- More registers will make the system slower, such as increased costs in context switching (more data to save and restore)
- More registers will also increase operand size, because with more registers, more bits are required to address each individual registers (Only 5 bits required to address 32 registers, while 8 bits required to address 256 registers)

Program counter (PC)

- 64 bit register that holds the address of the next instruction

Notes

- X8 is the indirect result location register. This is used to pass the address location of an indirect result, for example, where a function returns a large structure.
- X16 and X17 are IP0 and IP1, which are intra-procedure-call temporary registers. These can be used by call veneers and similar code, or as temporary registers for intermediate values between subroutine calls. They are corruptible by a function. Veneers are small pieces of code which are automatically inserted by the linker, for example when the branch target is out of range of the branch instruction.
- X18 is the platform register and is reserved for the use of platform ABIs. This is an additional temporary register on platforms that don't assign a special meaning to it.
- X28 is the stack pointer register (SP). It stores the location of the top of the stack
- X29 is the frame pointer register (FP). It points to the base of the stack frame, and parameters that are passed into the subroutine remain at a constant spot relative to the frame pointer
- X30 is the link register (LR). It stores the address to return to once the function call completes

### Memory Organisation

64-bit address bus of the LEGv8 processor

- LEGv8 memory is byte-addressable: Each memory address references 1 bytes
- Hence with 64 bit addresses, the processor can use $2^{64}$ bytes
- In 64-bit ARM processors, each dword consists of 64 bits, which is 8 bytes

| Address               | Instruction |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| 0x0000_0000_0000_0000 | 0xAC        |
| 0x0000_0000_0000_0001 | 0x1C        |
| 0x0000_0000_0000_0002 | 0xBD        |
| 0x0000_0000_0000_0003 | 0x45        |
| 0x0000_0000_0000_0004 | 0x27        |
| 0x0000_0000_0000_0005 | 0x84        |
| 0x0000_0000_0000_0006 | 0xAD        |
| 0x0000_0000_0000_0007 | 0xCC        |
| ...                   | ...         |
| 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFA | 0xCC        |
| 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFB | 0xFF        |
| 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFC | 0x11        |
| 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFD | 0x36        |
| 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFE | 0x16        |
| 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF | 0x72        |

Instruction size of LEGv8 is 32 bits = 4 bytes

- Each instruction takes up 4 entries in the table above
- The address of each instruction is a multiple of 4 (The last 2 bits are 00)
- Address of the next instruction is always 4 more than that of the current instruction

| Address               | Instruction |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| 0x0000_0000_0000_0000 | 0xAC1CBD45  |
| 0x0000_0000_0000_0004 | 0x2784ADCC  |
| 0x0000_0000_0000_0008 | ...         |
| ...                   | ...         |
| 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFF4 | ...         |
| 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFF8 | ...         |
| 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFC | 0x11361672  |

Data size (in register file and Dmem) for LEGv8 is 64bits = 8 bytes

- Address of next 64 bit data from the data memory is 8 more than the address of the current 64 bit data

# From C to Machine Language

- Consider the following c statement: `f = (g + h) - (i + j)`
- Pseudo code instructions
  ```
  add t0, g, h
  add t1, i, j
  sub f, t0, t1
  ```
- Format for machine language: Opcode/mnemonic, operands, source/destination
- Operands must be registers, not variables
  ```
  ADD X9, X20, X21
  ADD X10, X22, X23
  SUB X19, X9, X10
  ```
- Each instruction needs to be encoded in 32 bits

## Classification of LEGv8 Instructions

Based on instruction format

- Each LEGv8 instruction is 32 bits, and it has different fields
  - Opcode, Destination register, Source register, Address of destination etc.
  - Opcode: Portion of a machine language instruction that specifies the operation to be performed (add, sub, or load and store etc)

Based on functionality

- Arithmetic/logical instructions
- Data transfer instructions
- Conditional instructions
- Unconditional instructions

## Classification of LEGv8 Instructions by Functionality

ALU instructions

- Arithmetic operations: `ADD`, `SUB`, `ADDI`, `SUBI` and their variants
- Logical operations: `AND`, `ORR`, `EOR`, `ANDI`, `ORRI`, `EORI` etc.
- Shift operations: `LSL`, `LSR`, etc

Data transfer instructions

- `LDUR`, `STUR`, `LDURB` (load byte), `STURB` (store byte) etc.
- Load and store: memory to register (load) and register to memory (store)

Conditional branch and unconditional branch: Changes the sequence of execution of instructions

- Condition codes, set from arithmetic instructions with the `S` suffix (`ADDS`, `ADDIS`, `ANDS`, `ANDIS`, `SUBS`, `SUBIS`, etc.)
  - Negative (`N`): Result has 1 in the most significant bit (MSB)
  - Zero (`Z`): Result was 0
  - Overflow (`V`): Result has overflowed
  - Carry (`C`): Result had carryout from MSB

## ALU instructions: Logical Operations

| Instruction            | Example           | Meaning       | Comments                                  |

| ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Load register    | `LDUR X1, [X2, 40]`   | X1 = Memory[X2 + 40] | Load dword from memory to register             |
| Store register   | `STUR X1, [X2, 40]`   | Memory[X2 + 40] = X1 | Store dword from register to memory            |

## Conditional and Unconditional Operations

| Instruction                       | Example       | Meaning                            | Comments                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Compare and branch if equal 0     | `CBZ X1, 25`  | if X1 == 0, go to PC + 100         | Equal 0 test; PC-relative branch      |
| Compare and branch if not equal 0 | `CBNZ X1, 25` | if X1 != 0, go to PC + 100         | Not equal 0 test; PC-relative branch  |
| Branch conditionally              | `B.cond 25`   | if (condition true) go to PC + 100 | Test condition codes; if true, branch |
| Branch unconditionally            | `B 2500`      | go to PC + 10000                   | Branch to target address; PC-relative |
| Branch to register                | `BR X30`      | go to x30                          | For switch, procedure return          |
| Branch with link                  | `BL 2500`     | x30 = PC + 4, PC + 10000           | For procedure call PC-relative        |

Note

- For `CBZ X1, 25`, this means I want to branch with an address offset of 25. But since 25 is a word address (recall words are 32 bits, or 4 bytes), we have to convert it to byte-addressible, hence 25\*4 = 100. We shift by 100

Conditional branch

- `B.EQ` branch if equal
- `B.NE` branch if not equal
- `B.LT` branch if less than (signed), `B.LO`, branh if less than (unsigned)
- `B.LE` branch if less than or equal to (signed), `B.LS` branch if less than or equal to (unsigned)
- `B.GT` branch if greater than or equal to (signed), `B.HI` branch if greater than or equal to (unsigned)
- `B.GE` branch if greater than or equal (signed), `B.HS` branch if greater than or equal (unsigned)

## Classification of LEGv8 Instruction based on Instruction Format

There are 3 different instruction formats

1. Register format (R-format)
2. Data transfer format (D-format)
3. Immediate format (I-format)

We have multiple instruction formats to allow for flexibility when writing instructions

### Register Format

| opcode  | Rm     | shamt  | Rn     | Rd     |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 11 bits | 5 bits | 6 bits | 5 bits | 5 bits |

- All data values (operands/results) are located in registers
- `opcode` operation code: Specifies type of instruction
- `Rn` and `Rm`: Specify the first and second source registers respectively
  - Note that `Rn` is the first, `Rm` is the second
- `shamt` stands for the shift amount: Specifies the number of bit positions to be shifted (used in shift instructions)
- `Rd` specifies the destination register

For example,

```
ADD X9, X20, X21
```

| opcode      | Rm    | shamt  | Rn    | Rd    |
| ----------- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| 10001011000 | 10101 | 000000 | 10100 | 01001 |

- Opcode: `ADD`
- Rm: 21 (The second register)
- shamt: 0 (No shift was done)
- Rn: 20 (The first register)
- Rd: 9 (The destination register)

The instruction is now a single binary string `10001011000 10101 000000 10100 01001` = `0x8B150289` which the CPU knows what to do

1. Read address 1 (10100) and place value in ALU
2. Read address 2 (10101) and place value in ALU
3. ALU checks opcode (1001011000) and performs operation
4. ALU adds them together
5. ALU writes the result in Rd (01001)

### Data Transfer Type

| Opcode  | Address | Op2    | Rn     | Rt     |
| ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 11 bits | 9 bits  | 2 bits | 5 bits | 5 bits |

- Used for load/store instructions
- `Rn`: Specifies the base register
- `Address`: Constant offset from contents of the base register (+- 32 dwords)
- `Rt`: Specifies the destination (target) register (load) or source (store) register number
  - ALU calculates the address (address + [Rn])
  - Data at memory location (address + [Rn]) is read
- The read data is saved in the destination register Rt

Consider the instruction `LDUR X9, [X22, #64]`

| Opcode | Address | Op2 | Rn  | Rt  |
| ------ | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1986   | 64      | 0   | 22  | 9   |

1. Read data from `Rn`
2. Take that initial value from `Rn`, and add `Address` to it in the ALU
   - Note that the value from `Rn` is 64 bit (since we are using 64 bit registers), but the value of `Address` is only 9 bits. Hence we have to sign-extend `Address` when adding it
3. With this value, go to memory and read the value at that part of memory
4. Take that value from memory, and store it in `Rt`

Consider another instruction, `STUR X9, [X22, #64]`

| Opcode | Address | Op2 | Rn  | Rt  |
| ------ | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1984   | 64      | 0   | 22  | 9   |

1. Read `Rn` value
2. Take initial value from `Rn`, and add `Address` to it in the ALU. This is the overall address in memory to store our data at
3. Read the value of `Rt`
4. Store the value of `Rt` to memory with the address found in step 2

### Immediate Instruction Type

| Opcode  | Immediate | Rn     | Rd     |
| ------- | --------- | ------ | ------ |
| 10 bits | 12 bits   | 5 bits | 5 bits |

- `Rn`: Source register
- `Rd`: Destination register
- `Immediate`: Stores the immediate value. Immediate field is zero-extended
- `Opcode`: Opcode is reduced to 10 bits, to have more range for immediate field

Consider the instruction `ADDI X1, X2, #50`

| Opcode | Immediate | Rn  | Rd  |
| ------ | --------- | --- | --- |
| 580    | 50        | 2   | 1   |

1. Read the value in `Rn`
2. Add `Immediate` with value read from `Rn` together in the ALU
3. Store the value at `Rd`

## Conditional Instructions

- Branch to a labelled instruction if the condition is true, else continue sequentially
- `CBZ X0, L1`
  - If (X0 == 0) go to instruction labelled L1
- `CBNZ X0, L1`
  - If (X0 != 0) go to instruction labelled L1
- `B L1`
  - Branch unconditionally to L1

### Compiling If Statements

Consider the following C code

```c
if (i == j) {
  f = g + h;
} else {
  f = g - h;
}
```

When compiled to LEGv8,

```
      SUB X9, X22, X23 // X9 = i - j
      CBNZ X9, Else // if (i - j != 0) go to Else
      ADD X19, X20, X21 // f = g + h
      B Exit
Else: SUB X9, X20, X21 // f = g - h
Exit: ...
```

### LEGv8 Instruction Format - Conditional Branch

- Based on condition

  - `CBZ`: Branch if equal to zero
  - `CBNZ`: Branch if not equal to zero

  | Opcode | Address | Rt     |
  | ------ | ------- | ------ |
  | 8 bits | 19 bits | 5 bits |

  - Example: `CBZ X19, Exit`

  | Opcode | Address | Rt  |
  | ------ | ------- | --- |
  | 180    | Exit    | 19  |

  - Addressing mode is PC-relative
    - Relative to the program counter
    - New address = PC + address

#### PC-Relative Addressing

`CBZ X19, 3`

- If X19 == 0
  - PC = PC + 3 \* 4
  - Remember that the number is based on "word-addressable" (4 bytes) while the overall jump is "byte-addressable"
  - PC = PC + 3 << 2
  - Note that a left shift of 2 is the same as multiplying by 4

### LEGv8 Instruction Format - Unconditional Branch

| Opcode | Address |
| ------ | ------- |
| 6 bits | 26 bits |

- B-type instructions: Are used when unconditional branch in instruction sequence is to be performed
- For branch we need to change content of program counter (PC) which stores the address of the next instruction to be executed
- `B 8`
  | Opcode | Address |
  | ------ | ------- |
  | 5 | 8 |
  - PC = PC + 8 \* 4

# ISA Design Issues

Design goals

- Simple microarchitecture implementation, low hardware complexity
- High performance
- Low power: Less data movement, scope for parallel and pipeline implementation
- Progammability: Easy to translate high-level programs into low-level machine code
- Compatability: Programmability across generation

Design issues

- Selection of operations to be executed by the instructions -> size of instruction set and opcodes
- Operand locations: Registers, in memory, or both
- Addressing modes and instruction format
- Register size, word size, memory address space and address size

## CISC and RISC Design Policy

- CISC and RISC are 2 basic design philosophies of ISA design
- CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) developed in the early '60s
  - Aims at small program memory and less compiler workload
  - Involves large instruction set comprised of complex and specialised instructions (transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentiation), and string manipulation, to have fewer instructions per task
- RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) developed in the late '70s
  - Based on the 80/20 rule: 80% of the instructions use 20% of the instruction set
  - All computing tasks can be performed by a small instruction set comprised of simple instructions
  - Each instruction can be executed in a single clock cycle of short duration

### RISC Design Features

- Small and simple instruction set
  - Fixed opcode-width and fewer addressing modes, fixed instruction length, fewer instruction formats with common fields
    - Advantages: Simple and fast hardwired decoding and control generation, shorter clock period, load/store architecture
  - Only 2 instructions (load and store) and only one addressing mode for memory access: all operands and destination are located in registers
  - All instructions are executed in a single cycle
    - Advantages: Makes superscalar/instruction pipelining simpler

### CISC Design Features

- Source and destination can be in registers/memory/both
  - Relatively longer clock period involves less registers
- Several addressing modes and multiple displacement (offset) sizes
  - Instruction length varies according to address mode
  - Complex instruction-decoding logic
- Instructions are microcoded, executed in multiple clock cycles
- Program code size is relatively small
- CISC implementations translate the instruction to RISC like microinstructions to realise pipelining
- Less compilation effort: Complexity lies in micro-program level

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Many complex instructions in the instruction set                            | Fewer simple instructions in the instruction set                             |
| Many formats, and several addressing modes to support complex instructions  | Fewer instruction formats, and a few addressing modes                        |
| Instruction length varies according to addressing mode                      | Fixed instruction length - simpler instructions                              |
| Instructions are microcoded, and executed in multiple clock cycles          | Hardwired decoding: Single cycle instruction execution                       |
| Memory can be referenced by many different modes                            | Only load/store instructions can reference memory                            |
| Operands could be memory: higher clock period: less number of registers     | Operands in register for faster clocking: more registers: less memory access |
| Difficult to pipeline and super-scalar implementation                       | Easy to pipeline and superscalar implementation                              |
| Program code size is relatively small: complexity is in micro-program level | Program code size is usually large: Complexity is in the compiler            |
| Higher complexity of instruction implementation: CPI is more than 1         | More compile time: More registers and more cache area                        |

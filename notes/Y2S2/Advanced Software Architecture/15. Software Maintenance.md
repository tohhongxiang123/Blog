# Software Maintenance

What is software maintenance about?

- Fundamentals
  - Nature of maintenance
  - Software evolution
- Key issues
  - Cost
  - Designing for maintainability
- Techniques
  - Reverse engineering
  - Re-engineering

# Development vs Maintenance Costs

- Any work done to the system after it is in operation is considered maintenance
- On average, 20% of the effort goes into development, 80% into maintenance

# Nature of Maintenance

- Correction
  - Corrective
  - Preventive
- Enhancement
  - Adaptive
  - Perfective
- Metrics
  - Defect rate
  - Mean time to change

# Maintenance Prediction and Prediction Model

Predicting system changes

- What parts of the system are most likely to be affected by change requests?
- How many change requests can be expected?

Predicting maintainability

- Which parts of the system will be most expensive to maintain?

Predicting maintenance costs

- What will be the lifetime maintenance costs of this system?
- What will be the costs of maintaining this system over the next year?

# Lehman's Laws

| Law                      | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Continuing change        | A program that is used in a real-world environment must change or become progressively less useful in that environment                                  |
| Increasing complexity    | As an evolving program changes, its structure tends to become more complex. Extra resources must be devoted to preserving and simplifying the structure |
| Declining quality        | The qualityof systems will appear to be declining unless they adapt to changes in their operational environment                                         |
| Organisational stability | Over a program's lifetime, its rate of development is approximately constant and independent of the resources devoted to the system development         |

# Importance of Evolution

- Organisations have huge investments in their software systems - they are critical business assets
- To maintain the value of these assetse to the business, they must be changed and updated
- The majority of the software budget in large companies is devoted to evolving existing software rather than developing new software

# Legacy System Evolution

- Organisations that rely on legacy systems must choose a strategy for evolving these systems
  - Scrap system completely, and modify business processes so that it is no longer required
  - Continue maintaining the system
  - Transform the system with re-engineering to improve its maintainability
  - Replace the system with a newer system
- The strategy chosen should depend on the system quality and its business value

# Key Issues in Maintenance

- Technical
  - Limited understanding
  - Test coverage
  - Poor maintainability to begin with
- Management
  - Staffing - morale, skillset
  - Contractual responsibility - service level agreement
- Cost
- Measurement

# Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Components

- Building large systems by integrating COTS systems is now a viable development strategy for some types of systems, such as e-commerce systems
  - COTS are usually complete application systems that offer an API (application programming interface)
  - COTS usually help with faster application development
  - COTS also usually lower development costs

# Design Decisions with COTS

- Which COTS products offer the most appropriate functionality?
  - There may be several similar products that may be used
- How will data be exchanged?
  - Individual products use their own data structures and formats
- What features of the product will actually be used?
  - Most products have more functionality than is needed. You should try to deny access to unused functionality

# Maintenance Consideration with COTS

- Lack of control over functionality and performance - COTS systems may be less effective than they appear
- Problems with COTS system inter-operability - Different COTS systems may make different assumptions that means integration is difficult
- No control over system evolution - COTS vendors, not system users, control evolution of the COTS product
- Support from COTS vendors - COTS vendors may not offer support over the lifetime of the product

# System Re-Engineering

System Re-Engineering is

- Re-structuring or re-writing part or all of a legacy system without changing its functionality
- Involves adding effort to make the sub-systems easier to maintain
- The system may be restructured and re-documented

System re-engineering is applicable when some (but not all) sub-systems of a larger system require frequent maintenance

# Re-engineering Process

- Reverse engineering
  - Analyse software to identify components and their relationships
  - Create representation at higher levels of abstractions (e.g. documentation, UML diagrams, ER diagrams)
- Forward engineering
  - Programme structure improvement
  - Programme modularisation
  - Data re-engineering

# Re-engineering Cost Factors

- Quality of software being re-engineered
- Tool support available for re-engineering
- Extent of data conversion which is requried
- Availability of expert staff for re-engineering
  - This can be a problem with old systems based on technology that is no longer widely used

# Design for Maintainability

# Applying Law of Maintenance to Design

-   Software industry laws: Second law of Lehman's laws
    -   As an E-type system (a system that is intertwined with processes of real life) evolves, its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain/reduce it
    -   Change -> complexity -> takes resources
-   Idea 1: To create separate modules and with good modularity
    -   Well defined
    -   Conceptually simple
    -   Independent upon partitioning
        -   Low coupling
        -   High cohesion
    -   With well-defined interfaces

# More Design Ideas for Change

Apply the law of maintenance to overall goal, of design, then to ideas of design

-   Idea 2: Via decisions, ensuring encapsulation
-   Idea 3: Patterns

# Patterns in Software

-   A pattern is a model proposed for imitation for solving a software design proboelm
-   Used at different levels of abstraction of design problems
    -   Architectural patterns for entire systems
    -   Design patterns for collaborations between several classes
    -   Data structures and algorithms

# Defining Design Patterns

-   A design pattern is a way of reusing abstract knowledge about a problem and its solution
-   A pattern is a description of the problem, and the essence of its solution
-   It should be sufficiently abstract to be reused in different settings
-   Patterns often rely on object characteristics, such as polymorphism and inheritance

# Pattern Elements

-   Name: A meaningful pattern identifier
-   Problem description
-   Solution description: Not a concrete design, but a template for a design solution that can be instantiated in different ways
-   Consequences: The results and trade-offs of applying the pattern

# Architectural Patterns

-   Model-View-Controller (MVC)
-   Event driven
-   Shared-Data (Blackboard, Repository)
-   Pipe and filter
-   Layered
-   Peer-to-peer
-   Client-Server

## Layered Pattern

![Layered pattern](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/assets/sapr_0103.png)

-   Used to structure programs that can be decomposed into groups of subtasks, each of which is at a particular level of abstraction. Each layer provides services to the next higher layer
-   The most commonly found 4 layers of a general information system are
    1. Presentation Layer (UI layer)
    2. Application Layer (Service layer)
    3. Business Logic Layer (Domain layer)
    4. Data Access Layer (Persistence layer)
-   Usage
    -   General desktop applications
    -   E-commerce web applications

## Client-Server

![client server pattern](http://www.unified-am.com/UAM/UAM/guidances/reusableassets/resources/Arch-Pattern-client-server.png)

-   Consists of 2 parties: Multiple **clients**, and a **server**
-   Server provides services to multiple client components
-   Clients request services from the server, and the server provides the relevant services to those clients
-   Serve will continue to listen to client requests
-   Usage
    -   Online applications such as email, document sharing, banking

## Pipe-Filter Pattern

![pipe filter pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/_images/pipes-and-filters-solution.png)

-   Used to structure systems which produce and process a stream of data
-   Each processing step is enclosed within a **filter** component
-   Data to be processed is passed through **pipes**
-   Pipes can be used for buffering or synchronisation purposes
-   Usage
    -   Compilers: Consecutive filters perform lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation
    -   Workflows in bioninformatics

## Peer-to-Peer

![peer to peer pattern](https://www.btm-forum.org/boks/wikis/uam/UAM/guidances/reusableassets/resources/Arch-Pattern-p2p.png)

-   Individual components are known as peers
-   Peers may function both as a **client**, requesting services from other peers, and as a **server**, providing services to other peers
-   Peers may act as a client, or as a server, or as both. It can change its role dynamically with time
-   Usage
    -   File-sharing networks
    -   Cryptocurrency-based products such as blockchain

## Event

![Event driven](https://miro.medium.com/max/851/1*IxmhhYlP4VWGR7yp53lLuA.png)

-   Deals with events, has 4 major components
    1. Event source
    2. Event listener
    3. Channel
    4. Event bus
-   The source publishes messages to particular channels on an event bus
-   Listeners subscribe to particular channels
-   Listeners are notified of messages that are published to a channel to which they have subscribed before
-   Usage
    -   Android development
    -   Notification services

## Model-View-Controller Pattern

![model view controller pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC/model-view-controller-light-blue.png)

-   Divides an interactive application into 3 parts
    1. Model: Contains core functionality and data
    2. View: Displays information to the user (more than one view may be defined)
    3. Controller: Handles input from the user
-   This separates internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to, and accepted from, the user
-   Decouples components, allowing efficient code reuse
-   Usage
    -   Architecture for WWW application in major programming languages
    -   Web frameworks

## Blackboard Pattern

![blackboard pattern](https://dz2cdn1.dzone.com/storage/temp/7702241-blackboard-pattern-components.png)

-   Useful for problems for which no deterministic solution strategies are known. Consists of 3 main components
    1. Blackboard: A structured global memory containing objects from the solution space
    2. Knowledge source: Specialised modules with their own representation
    3. Control component: Selects, configures and executes modules
-   All components have access to the blackboard
-   Components may produce new data objects that are added to the blackboard
-   Coponents look for particular kinds of data on th eblackboard, and may find these by pattern matching with the existing knowledge source
-   Usage
    -   Speech recognition
    -   Vehicle identification and tracking
    -   Sonar signals intepretation

## Broker Pattern

![broker pattern](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*-aH7dLjvTU7OHBHIjfAv1g.jpeg)

-   Used to structure distributed systems with decoupled components
-   These components can interact with each other by remote service invocations
-   **Brokers** are responsible for the coordination of communication among components
-   Servers publish their capabilities (services and characteristics) to a broker
-   Clients request a service from the broker, and the broker then redirects the client to a suitable service from its registry
-   Usage
    -   Message broker software such as Apache

# Mid-Level Design Patterns

-   Broker Design Patterns
    -   Facade, Mediator
    -   Adaptor
    -   Proxy
-   Generator Design Patterns
    -   Factory
    -   Singleton
    -   Prototype
-   Reactor
    -   Command
    -   Observer

## Facade

![Facade pattern](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/Example_of_Facade_design_pattern_in_UML.png)

-   Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem
-   This pattern defines a higher-level interface that abstracts the complexity away, and makes the subsystem easier to use
-   For example, `brewCoffee()` hides the complexity required behind brewing coffee, such as grounding the coffee beans, boiling water, etc

## Adaptor

![adaptor pattern](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/images/adapter_pattern_uml_diagram.jpg)

-   A structural design pattern that allows 2 unrelated/uncommon interfaces to work together
-   Adapter makes 2 incompatible interfaces compatible, without changing existing code
-   Intefaces may be incompatible, but inner functionality should match the requirement

## Proxy

![proxy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Proxy_pattern_diagram.svg/439px-Proxy_pattern_diagram.svg.png)

-   A class functioning as an interface to something else
-   Proxy can interface to anything: Network connections, large object in memory, files etc
-   In short, a proxy is a wrapper or agent object that is being called by the client, to access the real serving object behind the scene
-   Usage of the proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object, or can provide additional logic such as input validation, or caching

## Factory

![factory](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/images/factory_pattern_uml_diagram.jpg)

-   A creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects, without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created
-   Objects are created by calling a factory method, either specified in an interface and implemented in child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes, rather than by calling a constructor

## Singleton

![singleton](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/images/singleton_pattern_uml_diagram.jpg)

-   Restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance
-   Useful when exactly 1 object is required to coordinate actions across the system

## Prototype

![prototype](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/images/prototype_pattern_uml_diagram.jpg)

-   Used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects
-   Used to avoid subclasses of an object creator in the client application, like the factory method pattern does, and to avoid teh inherent cost of creating a new object in the standard way (using `new`) when it is prohibitively expensive for a given application

## Command

![command](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/command/solution3-en.png)

-   A behavioral design pattern, useful to abstract business logic into discrete actions called commands
-   This command object helps in loose copuling between 2 classes where one class (invoker) calls a method on the other class (recevier) to perform a business operation

## Observer

![observer](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/observer/solution2-en.png)

-   A subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers
-   Subject notifies observers automatically of any state change in the subject, usually by calling a method in the observer

# Application Frameworks

-   Frameworks are a sub-system design with implementation specifics
-   Made up of a collection of abstract and concrete classes and the interfaces between them
-   Sub-system can be implemented by adding components to fill in the parts of the design and by instantiating the abstract classes in the framework

## Model-View-Controller (MVC)

-   System infrastructure framwork for Graphic User Interface (GUI) design
-   MVC frameworks involve the instantiation of a number of patterns (as discussed earlier under concept reuse)
-   Allows for multiple representations of an object, and separate interactions with these presentations

# Using Frameworks by Extending Them

-   Frameworks are considered generic, and are extended to create a more specific application or subsystem
-   Extending a framework involves
    -   Adding concrete classes that inherit operations from abstract classes in the framework
    -   Adding methods that are called in response to events that are recognised by the framework
-   Problem with frameworks is their complexity which means that it takes a long time to use them effectively

# Software Services and Web Services

-   Service
    -   A loosely-coupled, reusble software component that encapsulates discrete functionality
-   Web Service
    -   A service that is distributed and programmatically accessed
    -   A service that is accessed using standard internet and XML-based protocols

# Service-Orientation Design Principles

-   Well-defined interfaces: Well specified description of the service that permits consumers to invoke it in a standard way
-   Loose coupling: Service consumer is independent of the implemnetation specifics of service provider
-   Logical and physical separation of business logic from presentation logic: Service functionality is independent of user interface aspects
-   Highly reusable services: Services are designed in such a way that they are consumable by multiple applications
-   Coarse-grained granularity: Services are business-centric, i.e. reflect a meaningful business service, and not implementation details

# Project Scheduling

There are many techniques to schedule projects

- Activity network

- Critical Path Method (CPM)
    - Network techniques
    - Consider precedence relationshiops and interdependencies
    - Identify critical path and critical activities
        - A critical path in project management is the **longest sequence of activities that must be finished on time** in order for the entire project to be complete.

    - Node E is dependent on node G, D, and H to complete, before it can start

# Time Cost Models

1. Identify the critical path
2. Find cost per time unit, to expedite each node on the critical path
3. For cheapest node to expedite, reduce it as much as possible, or until critical path changes
    1. We expedite the cheapest node, because recall that crashing increases the cost of the project. Hence, by crashing the cheapest node, we increase the cost the least
4. Keep repeating 1-3 until the cost to complete the critical path is minimised

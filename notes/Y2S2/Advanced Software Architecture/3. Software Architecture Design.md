# Software Architecture Design

- Heterogeneous style
  - Combine different styles to design the system
- How styles can be combined
  - Hierarchically heterogeneous
  - Simultaneously heterogeneous
  - Locationally heterogeneous

## Hierarchical Heterogeneous Styles

![Hetereogeneous styles](https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/assets/9780429399602/graphics/fig3_4.jpg)

- A component in one style may have an internal styles developed in a completely different style
- For example, the Java Virtual Machine
  - JVM uses a virtual machine style
  - Key component of the architecture is the execution engine
  - We can use main-program and subroutine style to design the execution engine

## Simultaneously Heterogeneous Styles

- The architecture of a system can be described as a number of different styles
- For example, the MISOC 2000 system
  - Can be viewed as a client-server style, and at the same time, can be viewed as a layered system, where the clients call the server via remote procedural calls

## Locationally Heterogeneous Styles

- Different subsets of the components and connectors fall into different architectural styles

# Discussion

- There is no architectural design that is satisfactory overall design considerations
- There is a pattern of quality attributes for an architectural style used in different problems
- Tables may not be identical for different systems

Remember Software Design Principles

- Modularity
- Single responsibility principle
- Principle of least knowledge
- Open/Close principle

Design Process

- Iterative
- Multiple solutions
- Model-based

Design Strategies

- Decompositional design: Top down
- Compositional design: Bottom up
- Design patterns: Reuse of designs
- Evolutionary design: Trial and error

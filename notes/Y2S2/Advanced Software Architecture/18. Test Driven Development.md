# Test Driven Development

Problems faced with testing

- Time factor
  - More time pressure you feel, the fewer tests you write
  - Fewer tests written, less stable code
  - Reworks create more pressure

# Emergence of Test then Code

- Historically, the software development cycle places testing after coding
- However, we learnt that we can write black box tests for each functional requirement **before** writing the code that will meet those requirement
- Advantages
  - The suite of tests becomes something that can be run automatically as the program is developed
  - These tests are run every time the program is compiled, to ensure that new additions to the code do not break earlier functionality: Regression testing

# TDD

- Development
  - Function selection
  - Test case
  - Requirement
  - Validation
  - Phase 1: Fails -> Simple writing
  - Phase 2: Passes -> Reviewing
  - Phase 3: Refactor -> Complete

# Test FIrst Guideline

- The tests should drive you to write the code
- The reason you write code is to get a test to succeed
- You should only write the minimal amount of code to get a test to succeed

# Examples of Testing Software

- JUnit, Ant

# Why Use Testing Frameworks?

- Using a testing framework is beneficial because it forces you to explicitly declare the expected results of specific program execution routes
- When debugging, it is possible to write a test which expresses the result you want to achieve, and then debug until the test comes out positive
- By having a set of tests that test all the core components fo teh project, it is possible to modify specific areas of the project and immediately see the effects the modification has on other areas by the results of the test. Hence, side effects are quickly realised

# Software Refactoring

- Refactoring is the process of making improvements to a program to slow down degradation through change. It means modifying (but not adding functionality) a program to:
  - Improve its structure
  - Reduce its complexity
  - Make it easier to understand
- Refactoring does not change the behavior of the software

# Project Planning

-   The most time-consuming activity
-   Continuous activity from initial concept to system delivery. Plans must be regularly revised as new information becomes available
-   Various different types of plan may be developed to support the main software project plan that is concerned with schedule and budget

# Project Plan Structure

1. Introduction
2. Project organisation
3. Hardware and software resource requirements
4. Life cycle and process definition
5. Work breakdown
6. Project estimation and schedule
7. Monitoring and reporting mechanisms
8. Risk analysis

# Life Cycle

-   Defines the main activities or steps to accomplish something (wash dishes, build a boat, etc)
-   Provides a framework for
    -   Adopting process, methods, tools etc
    -   Analysing and estimating resources
    -   Studying effectiveness and quality

# Selection of Lifecycles

-   We know basic strengths and weaknesses
    -   Waterfall
    -   Rapid prototyping
    -   Incremental release
    -   Iterative
    -   Spiral
    -   Agile

# Life Cycles Selection Factors

-   Organisation and People Factors
    -   Skills
    -   Maturity
    -   Experience
-   Client Factors
    -   Requirements
    -   Expectations
-   Product Factors
    -   Size
    -   Complexity
-   Technology Factors
    -   Use of technology

# Defining the Software Development Process

-   Proecss contains a set of **activities, methods and practices** that are used in the production and evolution (maintenance and enhancement) of software
-   Process integrates **people, technology, activities and products**
-   Process defines **quantitiative measurement** for control
-   process has a **hierarchical** structure
-   Project's development lifecycle is the high level view of its software development process

# Process Decomposition

-   Process
    -   Activities
        -   Tasks
        -   Milestones
        -   Checkpoints

# Workbench: A Planning Process

-   Process
    -   Project planning process
-   Entry Criteria
    -   Project descriptions, statement of work
    -   Earlier versions of project management plan
-   Process description
    -   The project planning process identifies scope, select life cycle, define process, estimate cost, and allocate resources etc. for the project
-   Milestones
    -   Project plan document
-   Exit criteria
    -   Project plan is approved

## Work Breakdown

For each lifecycle iteration:

-   Identify the project's scope
-   Define the process for the lifecycle
-   Estimate the size, duration, effort, costs etc. for the lifecycle
-   Break down the work required
-   Sequence project tasks for the project
-   Allocate resources for each task
-   Document in Project Management Plan
-   Record performance data (hours worked, milestones accomplished, other data as specified in project management plan)
-   Compare estimation vs actual performance, take corerctive action where necessary

E.g. of work package/task

-   Project: Agent software system
-   Work package: Project plan
-   Assigned to: John Cena
-   Effort: 8 person days
-   Start date: 04/05/2020
-   Purpose: To determine a draft plan for the project, to be refined in later work packages
-   Inputs: SRS
-   Activities: This work package includes providing a brief overview of the project, its objectives, a set of processes and work packages, cost esimation and work schedules throughout the software development cycles
-   Output: A written document of the project plan

# Project Risk Management

-   Project risk management is the art and science of identifying analysing and responding to risk throughout the life of a project, and in the best interests of meeting project objectives
-   Risk management is often overlooked in projects, but it can help improve project success by helping select good projects, determining project scope, and developing realistic estimates

Benefits of software risk management practices

-   Anticipate/avoid problems
-   Prevent surprises
-   Improve ability to negotiate
-   Meet customer commitments
-   Reduce schedule slips
-   Reduce cost overruns

# Negative Risk

-   The possibility of a bad event occurring
-   Negative risk involves understanding potential problems that might occur in the project, and how they might impede project success
-   Negative risk management is like a form of insurance: It is an investment

# Positive Risk

-   The possibility of a good event occurring. Sometimes called opportunities
-   Goal of project risk management is to minimise negative risks, while maximising positive risks

# Risk Utility

![Risk utility function](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrea-Verzobio/publication/327255716/figure/fig2/AS:670468747034634@1536863614811/Utility-function-for-risk-seeking-risk-neutral-and-risk-adverse-agents.png)

-   Risk utility or risk tolerance is the amount of satisfaction or pleasure received from a potential payoff
    -   Utility rises at a decreasing rate for people who are risk-averse
    -   For those who are risk-seeking, have a higher tolerance for risk, and their satisfaction increases when more payoff is at stake
    -   The risk-neutral approach achieves a balance between risk and payoff

# Project Risk Management Processes

-   Planning risk management: Deciding how to approach and plan the risk management activities for the project
-   Identifying risks: Determining which risks are likely to affect a project, and documenting the characteristics of each
-   Performing qualitative risk analysis: Prioritising risks based on their probability and impact of occurrence
-   Performing quantitative risk analysis: Numerically estimating the effects of risks on project objectives
-   Planning risk responses: Taking steps to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to meeting project objectives
-   Controlling risk: Monitoring identified and residual risks, identifying new risks, carrying out risk response plans, and evaluating the effectiveness of risk strategies throughout the life of the project

# Planning Risk Management

-   The main output of this process is a risk management plan - a plan that documents the procedures for managing risk throughout a project
-   The project team should review project documents and understand teh organisation's and the sponsor's approaches to risk
-   The level of detail will vary with the needs of the project

# Topics Addressed in a Risk Management Plan

-   Methodology
-   Roles and responsibilities
-   Budget and schedule
-   Risk categories
-   Risk probability and impact
-   Revised stakeholders tolerances
-   Tracking
-   Risk documentation

# Contingency and Fallback Plans, Contingency Reserves

-   Contingency plans: Predefined actions that the project team will take if an identified risk event occurs
-   Fallback plans: Developed for risks that have a high impact on meeting project objectives, and are put into effect if attempts to reduce the risk are not effective
-   Contingency reserves or allowances: Provisions held by the project sponsor or the organisation to reduce the risk of costs or schedule

# Common Sources of Risk in Information Technology Projects

-   Market risk
-   Financial risk
-   Technology risk
-   People risk
-   Structure/process risk

# Risk Breakdown Structure

-   A risk breakdown structure is a hierarchy of potential risk categories for a project
-   Similar to work breakdown structure, but used to identify and categorise risk

![Risk breakdown structure](https://web-static.wrike.com/blog/content/uploads/2020/08/Understanding-Risk-Breakdown-Structure-2.png?av=d14c5c803f16a4fb9c8f16281df3630e)

# Identifying Risks

-   Identifying risks is the process of understanding what potential events might hurt or enhance a particular project
-   Another consideration is the likelihood of advanced discovery
-   Risk identification tools and techniques include
    -   Brainstorming
    -   Delphi Technique
    -   Interviewing
    -   SWOT analysis

## Brainstorming

-   A technique by which a group attempts to generate ideas or find a solution for a specific problem by amassing ideas spontaneously and without judgement
-   An experienced facilitator should run the brainstorming session
-   Be careful not to overuse/misuse brainstorming
    -   Psychology literature shows that individuals produce a greater number of ideas working alone, than they do through brainstorming in small, face-to-face groups
    -   Group effects often inhibit idea generation

## Delphi Technique

-   A technique used to derive a consensus among a panel of experts who make predictions about future developments
-   Provides independent and anonymous input regarding future events
-   Uses repeated rounds of questioning and written responses, and avoids the biasing effects possible in oral methods, such as brainstorming

## Interviewing

-   Interviewing is a fact-finding technique for collecting information in a face-to-face, phone, email, or instant-messaging discussion
-   Interviewing people with similar project experiences is an important tool for identifying potential risks

## SWOT Analysis

-   SWOT (Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) can also be used during risk identification
-   Helps identify the broad negative and positive risks that apply to a project

# Risk Register

![Risk register template](https://www.stakeholdermap.com/risk/risk-register-of-common-project-risks.png)

-   The main output of the risk identification process is a list of identified risks and other information needed to begin creating a risk register
-   A risk register is:
    -   A document that contains the results of various risk management processes and that is often displayed in a table or spreadsheet format
    -   A tool for documenting potential risk events and related information
-   Risk events refer to specific, uncertain events that may occur to the deteriment or enhancement of the project

# Risk Register Contents

-   Identification number for each risk event
-   A rank for each risk event
-   The name of each risk event
-   A description of each risk event
-   The category under which each risk event falls
-   The root cause of each risk
-   Triggers for each risk: Triggers are indicators or symptoms of actual risk events
-   Potential responses to each risk
-   The risk owner or person who wil own or take responsibility for each risk
-   The probability and impact of each risk occurring
-   The status of each risk

# Performing Qualitative Risk Analysis

-   Assess likelihood and impact of identified risks to determine their magnitude and priority
-   Risk quantification tools and techniques include
    -   Probability/impact matrices
    -   Top 10 risk item tracking
    -   Expert judgement

# Probability/Impact Matrix

-   Lists the relative probability of a risk occurring on one side of a matrix or axis on a chart, and the relative impact of the risk occurring on the other (Probability against impact)
-   List the risks and then label each on as high/medium/low in terms of its probability of occurrence, and its impact if it did occur
-   Can also calculate risk factors
    -   Numbers that represent the overall risk of specific events, based on their probability of occurring and the consequences to the project if they do occur

![Probability/Impact matrix](https://www.monday.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Risk-matrix.png)

# Top 10 Risk Item Tracking

-   A qualitative risk analysis tool that helps identify risks and maintain an awareness of risks throughout the life of a project
-   Establish a periodic review of the top ten project risk items
-   Lists the current ranking, previous ranking, number of times the risk appears on the list over a period of time, and a summary of the progress made in resolving the risk item

![Top 10 risk item tracking](https://slideplayer.com/slide/5227646/16/images/31/Table+Example+of+Top+Ten+Risk+Item+Tracking.jpg)

# Watch List

-   A watch list is a list of risks that are low priority, but are still identified as potential risks
-   Qualitative analysis can also identify risks that should be evaluated on a quantitative basis

# Performing Quantitative Risk Analysis

-   Often follows qualitative risk analysis, but both can be done together
-   Large, complex projects involving leading edge technologies often require extensive quantitative risk analysis
-   Main techniques include
    -   Decision tree analysis
    -   Simulations
    -   Sensitivity analysis

## Decision Trees and Expected Monetary Value (EMV)

-   A decision tree is a diagramming analysis technique, used to help select the best course of action in situations in which future outcomes are uncertain
-   Estimated monetary value (EMV) is the product of a risk event probability and the risk event's monetary value
-   You can draw a decision tree to help find the EMV

![Decision Trees and EMV](https://res.cloudinary.com/brainbok/image/upload/v1538887469/expected-monetary-value-emv-decision-tree-analysis.png)

## Simulation

-   Uses a representation or model of a system to analyse the expected behavior or performance of the system
-   Monte Carlo analysis, simulates a model's outcome many times to provide a statistical distribution of the calculated results
-   To use a Monte Carlo simulation, you must have 3 estimates (most likely, pessimistic and optimistic) plus an estimate of the likelihood of the estimate being between teh most likely and optimistic values

### Steps for Monte Carlo Analysis

![Monte carlo analysis for project scheduling](https://cdn.planacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/monte-carlo-analysis.jpg)

1. Assess the range for the variables being considered
2. Determining the probability distribution of each variable
3. For each variable, select a random value based on the probability distribution
4. Run a deterministic analysis or one pass through the model
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 many times to obtain the probability distribution of the model's results

## Sensitivity Analysis

-   A technique used to show the effects of changing one or more variables on an outcome
-   E.g., many people use it to determine what the monthly payments for a loan will be given different interest rates or periods of the loan, or for determing break-even points based on different assumptions
-   Spreadsheet software such as Excel, is a common tool for performing sensitivity analysis

# Planning Risk Responses

-   After identifying and quanitfying risks, you must decide how to respond to them
-   Four main response strategies for negative risks
    -   Risk avoidance
    -   Risk acceptance
    -   Risk transference
    -   Risk mitigation

## General Risk Mitigation Strategies for Technical, Cost and Schedule Risks

| Technical Risks                                             | Cost Risks                                                            | Schedule Risks                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Emphasize team support, avoid stand-alone project structure | Increase frequency of project monitoring                              | Increase frequency of project monitoring    |
| Increase project manager authority                          | Use WBS (work breakdown structure) and CPM (critical path management) | Use WBS and CPM                             |
| Improve problem handling and communication                  | Improve communication, project goals understanding and team support   | Select the most experienced project manager |
| Increase frequency of project monitoring                    | Increase project manager authority                                    |                                             |
| Use WBS and CPM                                             |                                                                       |                                             |

# Response Strategies for Positive Risks

-   Risk exploitation
-   Risk sharing
-   Risk enhancement
-   Risk acceptance

# Residual and Secondary Risks

-   It is also important to identify residual and secondary risks
-   Residual risks are risks that remain after all the response strategies have been implemented
-   Secondary risks are a direct result of implementing a risk response

# Controlling Risks

-   Involves executing the risk management process to respond to risk events and ensuring that risk awareness is an ongoing activity performed by the entire project team throughout the entire project
-   Workarounds are unplanned responses to risk events that must be done when there are no contingency plans
-   Main outputs of risk control are
    -   Work performance information
    -   Change requests
    -   Updates to the project management plan, other project documents, and organisational process assets

# Using Software to Assists in Project Risk Management

-   Risk registers can be created in a simple word/excel file or as part of a database
-   More sophisticated risk management software, such as monte carlo simlation tools, help in analysing project risks
-   You can purchase add-ons for excel and project 2010 to perform simulations

# Results of Good Project Risk Management

-   Unlike crisis management, good project risk management often goes unnoticed
-   Well-run projects appear to be almost effortless, but a lot of work goes into running a project well
-   Project managers should strive to make their jobs look easy to reflect the results of well-run projects

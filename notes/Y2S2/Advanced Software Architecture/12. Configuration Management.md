# Configuration Management

Configuration management is the process of identifying, organising and controlling system configuration and change

-   Controlling discipline to maintain system integrity

There are 3 parts of configuration management

1. Change control of configuration items
2. Version control of configuration items
3. Product building of configuration items

# Change Control

-   The management of change as one part of the configuration management process
-   Provides the tools to manage and control change to the system during implementation

# Version Control

-   The management of "product" versions as one part of the configuration management process
-   Provide the tools to manage and control the "product" versions generated during system implementation

# Product Building

-   The transformation of software and/or documentation source into a deliverable product as one part of the configuration management process
-   Provide the tools to manage and control an accurate, repeatable and documentable building process for software and documentation

# Why we need Software Configuration Management

-   Helps organisations/teams maintain consistency and control over what is produced
-   Ensures that
    -   Correct products are delivered (right versions)
    -   Products satisfy the requirements (traceability)
    -   Software and supporting materials (hardware, documents, training material, etc) are consistent (system integrity)

# Inherent Properties in SDLC

-   Conceptual phase: requirement change
-   Analysis phase: software change
-   Design phase: system/user documentation change
-   Implementation phase: schedule change
-   Testing phase: staff change
-   Maintenance phase: multiple releases

# Software Integrity

-   Software with integrity is software that
    -   Is traceable through life-cycle phases
    -   Works
    -   Meets user needs
    -   Is well designed
    -   Is delivered on time
    -   Is documented
    -   Meets estimated costs
    -   Is supported

# Configuration Item

-   A configuration item is a document, a section of a document, or a software-related item that is specifically placed under configuration control
-   Software configuration items may be
    -   Decomposed into further SCIs
    -   Modified to create new versions of the original SCIs

# Configuration Mangement Process

1. Configuration Identification
    - Identify items to be controlled
    - Establish identification schemes
    - Establish tools and techniques to be used
2. Configuration Control
    - Manage change during SDLC
3. Configuration Status Accounting
    - Tracing configuration item through its complete lifecycle
4. Configuration Audit
    - Ensure conformance to required functional and physical characteristics

# Baseline

-   Is a foundation on which you build your product
-   Is usually a configuration item that has been agreed upon, generally through a review, walk-through or inspection process
-   Is collectively an ordered collection of agreed-upon configuration items

A baseline is a set of configuration items **formally designated and fixed** at a specific point in time

-   Before establishment of baseline: Changes can be made quickly and informally
-   After establishment of baseline: Changes to the SCI can only be made under a formal change control procedure

Typically, a baseline with a SCI will be established once a deliverable form of the SCI has been completed, or after the formal technical review of an SCI. Subsequent baselines may be established for specific purposes, e.g. testing

# Change Control: Types of Changes

-   Discrepancies
    -   Bugs
    -   Documented error
    -   Development error
    -   Violation of development standard
-   Requested changes
    -   Unimplementable requirement
    -   Enhancement
    -   Improvement

In a change, we need to make a modification request

-   Modification request
    -   Content
        -   Number
        -   Originator
        -   Description
        -   Type
        -   Priority
        -   Generic, release, or version
        -   Date
        -   Proposed solution and cost estimate
        -   Due date
        -   Resolution
        -   Status

# Change Control Board

-   Principles
    -   Authority
    -   Solitary responsibility
    -   Specificity
    -   Responsiveness
-   Characteristics
    -   Hierarchies
    -   Scope
    -   Composition
-   Activities
    -   Make design decisions
    -   Support and make project direction decisions
    -   Process discrepancy and requested modification requests

# Version Tree

-   Created by evolving requirements
-   Created by change
-   Required for product support
    -   Phased deliveries
    -   Incremental releases
    -   Specialised products

Version

-   Used to indicate state of a configuration item at a well-defined point in time
-   E.g. Version V1, Version V2, Version V3

Variants

-   Collectively refer to versions that coexist (typically to support different hardware, operating systems or customer requirements)

# Branch

![Branch](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:a905ddfd-973a-452a-a4ae-f1dd65430027/01%20Git%20branch.svg?cdnVersion=235)

-   A line of development that exists independently of another line, yet still shares a common history, and can be merged in the future

# Summary

Product building is change-driven (i.e. date and dependency), and dependent on inter-data file relationships

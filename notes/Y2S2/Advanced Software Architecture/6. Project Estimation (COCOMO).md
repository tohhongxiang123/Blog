# Project Estimation (COCOMO)

Recall the steps in creating a project estimate

1. Estimate the size of the product/system
2. Estimate the effort required to create the system (e.g. in person-months)
3. Estimate the duration required (calendar time)
4. Estimate the manpower required
5. Estimate the costs
6. Estimate the phase schedule

# COCOMO Model

The information we require are the following:
1. Size
2. Cost drivers
3. Constraints and priorities

## Cost (or Productivity) Drivers

- Additional parameters that affect productivity
    - Product attributes
    - Project attributes
    - Personnel attributes
    - Hardware attributes

## Constraints and Priorities

- Examples of constraints:
    - Maximum schedule
    - Maximum effort
    - Maximum cost
- Priority examples:
    - Least cost, or shortest schedule, or smallest number of staff required is top priority

# COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model)

- COCOMO 81

| Model Type   | Effort                                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic        | Size (Static single-valued model)                         |
| Intermediate | Size + cost drivers                                       |
| Advanced     | Size + cost drivers + driver impact on each project phase |

## COCOMO 81: Basic Model

- Effort E = a (KDSI)^b
    - KDSI: Kilo delivered source instructions
- Duration D = c(E)^d
- Recommended staff size S = E / D
- Constants for different development modes

| Development Mode | a   | b    | c   | d   |
| ---------------- | --- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Organic          | 2.4 | 1.05 | 2.5 | .38 |
| Semi-detached    | 3.0 | 1.12 | 2.5 | .35 |
| Embedded         | 3.6 | 1.2  | 2.5 | .32 |

## COCOMO 81: Intermediate Model

- Uses slightly different 'a' constants
    - Organic (3.2)
    - Semi-detached (3.0)
    - Embedded (2.8)
- Adds "Effort Adjustment Factor" (EAF) computed from 15  cost drivers
- EAF is the product of the cost drivers
    - Effort E = a (KDSI)^b * EAF
    - Duration D = c(E)^d
    - EAF = Val1 * Val2 * ... * Valn, where Vali is the rating value of cost driver i

### Cost Drivers

- Personnel attributes: Analyst capability, application experience, programming language experience
- Product attributes: Required reliability, database size, product complexity etc
- Project attributes: Modern programming practices, software tools, schedule constraints
- Hardware attributes: Execution time constraints, storage constraints

![Examples of cost drivers in COCOMO intermediate model](http://www.expertsmind.com/CMSImages/385_Explain%20cost%20drivers%20and%20EAF%20of%20intermediate%20COCOMO%20model1.png)

## COCOMO II 1997: Efforts

- Effort = 2.94 * EAF * (KSLOC)^E
    - EAF is the effort adjustment factor derived from the cost drivers. It is the product of the cost drivers
    - E is an exponent derived from the 5 scale drivers (precedentedness, development flexibility, architecture/risk resolution, team cohesion, process maturity)

## COCOMO II 1997: Duration

- Duration = 3.67 * Effort^SE
    - Effort is the effort from the COCOMO II effort equation
    - SE is the schedule equation exponent derived from the 5 scale drivers

### Scale Drivers

| Scale Factor                   | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Precedentedness (PREC)         | Reflects the previous experience of the organisation                       |
| Development flexibility (FLEX) | Reflects the degree of flexibility in the development process              |
| Risk Resolution (RESL)         | Reflects the extent of risk analysis carried out                           |
| Team Cohesion (TEAM)           | Reflects how well the develpoment team knows each other and works together |
| Process Maturity (PMAT)        | Reflects the process maturity of the organisation                          |

### Using Historical Project Data

- The best "estimation model" is based on your own organisation's historical data

# Project Cost 

- Internal cost (Cost to developers)
    - Labour (team)
    - Software and hardware
    - Overheads (rent, utilities, office supplies, executive salaries, etc.)
- Profit margin (less other factors at work)
- Internal cost + profit margin = External cost (Cost to client)

# From Effort or Duration to a Phase Schedule

- Estimate the percentage of time spent in each phase
    - Requirements analysis
    - Architectural design
    - Detailed design
    - Coding and unit testing
    - Integration and testing

## Schedule Compression

- Desired schedule / initial schedule = compression factor
    - E.g. 8 months / 10.7 months = 75%
- Compressed schedule effort = initial effort / compression factor
    - 46.8 PM / 75% = 62.4PM
- Extra 15.6PM to reduce schedule by about 3 calendar months
- 25% reduction in schedule = 33% increase in efforts

Compression = Shrink schedule by adding people
- Team size = Effort / duration
    - 46.8 PM / 10.7 months = 4.4 people
    - 62.4 PM / 8 months = 7.8 people

### Schedule Compression Limits

2 techniques of shortening project duration
- Fast tracking
- Crashing

![Schedule compression](https://res.cloudinary.com/brainbok/image/upload/v1560523718/crashing-vs-fast-tracking-schedule-compression.png)

- Crashing is a schedule compression technique that involves determining an approach that brings maximum reduction in project duration with least incremental cost and risk, without changing project scope
    - Project schedule is compressed by **adding more resources to the project**, working overtime for critical path activities
    - Crashing increases risks, increases costs, and may not always result in a compressed schedule
- Fast tracking is a schedule compression technique that reduces the project duration by **performing critical path activities in parallel**, which were originally planned to be performed in sequence
    - Fast tracking can only work when activities can overlap to shorten the critical path duration
    - Fast tracking increases risks (especially quality risks), may cause a lot of reworking (since activities are done in parallel) and may also increase project costs

# Empirical Estimation Models

Effort = Tuning coefficient * size ^ exponent
- Effort: Usually derived as person-months of effort required to complete the project
- Tuning coefficient: A constant derived based on the complexity of the project
- Size: Usually LOC but may also be function point
- Exponent: Empirically derived

A dynamic multivariable model:
$$
E = [LOC * B^{0.333} / P]^3 * (1/t^4)
$$
- E: Effort in person-months or person-years
- t: Project duration in months or years
- B: Special skills factor
- P: Productivity parameter

# Verification Methods: Reviews

Purpose of verification:

-   To confirm that the system fulfils the specified design requirements

# Different Techniques for Different Defects

|                    | Requirement Faults | Design Faults | Code Faults | Documentation Faults |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| Reviews            | Fair               | Excellent     | Excellent   | Good                 |
| Prototypes         | Good               | Fair          | Fair        | NA                   |
| Testing            | Poor               | Poor          | Good        | Fair                 |
| Correctness Proofs | Poor               | Poor          | Fair        | Fair                 |

# Error Detection Rates for Code Faults

-   50% of errors are detected by code reviews
-   35% of errors are detected through white box testing
-   15% of errors are detected through black box testing

# Formal Technical Review

-   A method involving a structured encounter in which a group of technical personnel analyses or improves the quality of
    -   The original work product
    -   Methods

Types of reviews include:

-   Management reviews
-   Technical reviews
    -   Inspections
    -   Walk-throughs
-   Audits

# Purposes of Different Types of Reviews

-   Management reviews
    -   Monitor progress
    -   Determine status of plans and schedules
    -   Confirm requirements and system allocation
    -   Evaluate effectiveness of management approaches
-   Technical reviews
    -   Determine suitability for intended use
    -   Identify discrepancies from approved specs and standards
-   Audits
    -   Provide independent evluation of product conformance to reuglations, standards and plans

# Formal Technical Review is Well-Defined

-   Process
    -   Phases (orientation, etc)
    -   Procedures (checklists, etc)
    -   Input and Output, Entry and Exit criterion
-   Roles and responsibilities
    -   Moderator, reviewer, scribe, author, etc
-   Objectives
    -   Defect removal, requirements elicitation, etc
-   Measurements
    -   Forms, consistent data collection, etc

# Review Objectives

-   To ensure technical soundness
-   To ensure conformance to requirements
-   To ensure conformance to standards
-   To ensure consistency between various levels of documents
-   To ensure traceability throughout the product life cycle

# Reviews at SDLC Milestones

Requirements specification

-   CRR: Customer requirements review
-   CR: Contract Review
-   SRR: Software requirements review

Design

-   SDR: Software design review

Implementation

-   TR1R: Test readiness review

Testing

-   TR2R: Test Results Review

Maintenance

-   PPR: Post-project review

# Review Preparation (Pre-Review)

-   Notification
    -   Notify stakeholders on review objectives, time, venue
-   Distribution
    -   Distribute relevant materials
-   Choose participants
    -   Knowledge of material being reviewed
    -   Trained in review techniques

# Inspection Roles

-   Reader
    -   Presents the material (paraphrasing)
-   Author
    -   Corrects misconceptions
-   Inspectors (Reviewers)
    -   Identify errors
-   Recorder
    -   Completes the inspection minutes/log
-   Moderator
    -   Enforces procedures and keeps meeting on track

# Issue Classification

-   Critical
    -   Defects that may cause system to hang, crash, produce incorrect results or behavior, or corrupt user data
    -   No known work-arounds
-   Severe
    -   Defects that cause incorrect results/behaviors
    -   Known work-arounds
    -   Large and/or important areas of the system are affected
-   Moderate
    -   Defects that affect limited areas of functionality that can either be worked around, or ignored
-   Minor
    -   Defects that can be overlooked with no loss of functionality

# Review Execution

-   Sole purpose: To find errors (not fix them)
    -   Very important for review to stay "on track"
-   Keep review minutes
    -   Who attended
    -   How long the review lasted
    -   Record errors found, and action items assigned to correct them
    -   Amount of preparation time used
    -   Summarise review

# Review Follow-Up (Post-review)

-   Correction of errors
-   Re-review
    -   A 'review' should not be considered complete until all the errors found are corrected, and the corrections are reviewed/approved

# The Formal Technical Review Process

1. Planning: Choose team, materials, dates
2. Orientation: Present product, process, goals
3. Preparation: Check product, note issues
4. Review meeting: Consolidate issues
5. Rework: Correct defects
6. Verification: Verify product/process quality

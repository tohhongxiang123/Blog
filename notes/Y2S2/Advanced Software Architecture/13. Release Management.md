# Release Management

The process that handles software deployments and change initiatives
- Starts with planning what will be contained within a release
- Managing the software build through different stages and environments, testing stability and deployment

Release management is difficult because we need to balance
- Delivering value and novel features to customers
- Prioritising value streams according to business needs
- Improving the speed and quality of release deployments
- Not compromising product stability

# Roles of Release Management

- Delivering value to customers
- Scalable risk management
- Improving deployment efficiency

# Release

- A tested and approved baseline that is usually installed at a client site or packaged for purchase
- Has a unique ID, e.g. iOS 10.3.2, Windows 10, version 1607

# Patch

- A "minor release", not a whole build, but some subset of a build
- Generally done to fix one or more significant bugs
- Has a unique ID (e.g. Release 2.1-1)

# Tools Used for Release Management

- Version Control Software can be used to manage releases
- A good way to produce releases is through using various branches meant for release in VCS (version management tools)
- More or less in the context of VCS
    - E.g. of VCS: Mecurial, Git, Subversion

# Branch Dynamics in VCS

- There is a main branch or trunk
- Developers commit all new work to the trunk
- Developers create a release branch
- The trunk is copied to a release branch, and teams continue to work in parallel
- Branch is tagged and released
- Branch is maintained over time

# Release Management Process

- Creating a release management system
    - Create a checklist
    - Enforce the checklist
    - Standardise procedures across the organisation

# Release Preparation in VCS

- Through branches
    1. Create release branch
    2. Check out release branch
    3. Build and test release branch
    4. Create release distribution files
    5. Test distribution file contents
    6. Tag release
    7. Hand-off distribution file to QA

# Software Release Management Activities

- Distribution of software configuration item outside development activity
- Encompasses the identification, packaging, and delivery of the elements of the product release, e.g. executable program, documentation, release notes, configuration data
- Release management must consist of processes for internal (test team) or external (customer) releases
- Release management process must be designed to control a release that may consist of variants for different platforms

# Builds and Software Building

A build is the process of converting source code into standalone software artifacts (such as an executable programme to the customer or test team)
- Given a unique, often sequential ID
- Done of some regular basis (overnight, once a week)
- Comprises of a build list, which identifies all files and which revision of each to include in a build
- Correspond to a node in VCS graph

Each build must be
- Complete (self-sufficient)
- Repeatable (automatic, consistent)
- Informative (provides feedback)
- Schedulable (auto-triggered)
- Portable (independent of IDE)

# Release Distribution

- Manual approach
    - Physical media: CD's
    - Download from web page
- Automatic approach
    - Special software designed to eliminate the complicated installation and upgrade procedures -- deployment via java web start
    - Deployment and updates via the web, such as microsoft windows updates

# Build-Package-Deploy Configuration

- Source code repository - where the source code is stored
- Integration machine: Provide services to build/run/test source code
- Test server: Environment for test script to run
- Test script runner/load generator: Runs the test script
- Distribution server: Distributes built software

# Build-Package-Deploy Process

1. Checkout files
2. Prepare build directory
3. Compile 
4. Run unit tests
5. Package into JAR and WAR
6. Generate javadocs, release notes
7. Deploy in test environment
8. Run integration/system tests
9. Distribute
# Change Management

Software change is inevitable
- Errors must be repaired
- Performance/reliability of the system may have to be improved
- Business environment changes
- New requirements emerge when software is used
- New computers and equipment are added to the system

# First Law of Change Management

- No matter where you are in the system life cycle, the system will change, and the desire to change will persist throughout the life cycle

Types of changes that occur
- Change in business requirements
- Change in technical requirements
- Change in user requirements

# Baselines

- The IEEE Std. No. 610-12-1990 defines a baseline as:
    - A specification or product that has been formally reviewed and agreed upon, that thereafter serves as the basis for further development, and that can be changed only through formal change control procedures
- A baseline is a milestone in the development of software that is marked by the delivery of one or more software configuration items and the approval of these SCIs that is obtained through a formal technical review

# Repository Features

- Versioning
    - Saves all of these versions to enable effective management of product releases and to permit developers to go back to previous versions
- Dependency tracking and change management
    - The repository manages a wide variety of relationships among the data elements stored in it
- Requirements tracing
    - Provides the ability to track all the design and construction components and deliverables that result from a specific requirement specification
- Configuration management
    - Keeps track of a series of configurations representing specific project milestones or production releases. Version management provides the needed version, and link management keeps track of interdependencies
- Audit trails
    - Establishes additional information about when, why and by whom changes are made

# Version Control

- Version control combines procedures and tools to manage differnet versions of configuration objects that are created during the software process
- A version control system implements or is directly integrated with 4 major capabilities
    1. Project database (repository) that stores all relevant configuration objects
    2. A version management capapbility, that stores all versions of a configuration
    3. A make facility that enables the software engineer to collect all relevant configuration objects, and construct a specific version of the software
    4. An issues tracking (also called bug tracking) capability that enables the team to record and track the status of all outstanding issues associated with each configuration object

# Change Prediction

- Predicting the number of changes requires an understanding of the relationshiops between a system and its environment
- Tightly coupled systems require changes whenever the environment is changed
- Factors influencing this relationship are
    - Number and complexity of system interfaces
    - Number of inherently volatile system requirements: Volatile refers to requirements that reflect organisational policies rather than domain characteristics
        - E.g. only HR manager can view the employee records
    - The business processes where the system is used

# Change Control Boards (CCB)

- On moderate to large projects
- Two types of CCB
    - Project level CCB
    - Software CCB
- Role
    - Assesses impact of changes and approve change before it is implemented
    - Determines when the change will be released

# Steps of Change Control Process

1. Software Configuration Identification
2. Change Request (CR) initiated
3. CR analysed
4. CR approved (or rejected or deferred)
5. Change implemented and unit tested
6. Change integrated
7. Change validated
8. CR closed

# Change Request Form

- Project
- Requester
- Requested change
- Date

Change analyser:
- Components affected
- Associated components

Change assessment
- Change priority
- Change implementation

Change Control Board Decision
- Change implementation
- Quality Assurance/Testing

# Change Control Process: Evaluate Change

- Anyone submits CRF
- Developer evaluates CRF - Impact analysis performed to determine extent of modification
- If change is invalid, reject CRF. End
- Else, proceed
- Assess feasibility, cost, urgency of change
- CCB considers change request
- If not approved, inform user. End
- Else, proceed
- Implement change
- Do build
- End

# Change Implementation

1. Approved change request
2. Analyse requirements
3. Update requirements
4. Do development
5. Binaries documentation

# Change Control Process: Controlled Implementation

1. Change request queued for action
2. Individuals are assigned to work on relevant configuration items
3. SCIs are "checked out" of SCM system
4. Changes are made
5. Changes are reviewed and audited
6. New SCIs are "checked in" - new versions are created
7. Baseline for testing is established
8. QA and testing carried out

# Change Control Process: Controlled Build

1. Collect changes ready for next system release
2. Rebuild new version of the software, i.e. the release veresion
3. Changes to all SCIs are viewed and audited
4. Include changes in new release version
5. New release version is distributed to customers/other recipients

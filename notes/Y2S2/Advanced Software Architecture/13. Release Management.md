# Release Management

The process that handles software deployments and change initiatives
- Starts with planning what will be contained within a release
- Managing the software build through different stages and environments, testing stability and deployment

Release management is difficult because we need to balance
- Delivering value and novel features to customers
- Prioritising value streams according to business needs
- Improving the speed and quality of release deployments
- Not compromising product stability

# Roles of Release Management

- Delivering value to customers
- Scalable risk management
- Improving deployment efficiency

# Release

- A tested and approved baseline that is usually installed at a client site or packaged for purchase
- Has a unique ID, e.g. iOS 10.3.2, Windows 10, version 1607

# Patch

- A "minor release", not a whole build, but some subset of a build
- Generally done to fix one or more significant bugs
- Has a unique ID (e.g. Release 2.1-1)

# Tools Used for Release Management

- Version Control Software can be used to manage releases
- A good way to produce releases is through using various branches meant for release in VCS (version management tools)
- More or less in the context of VCS
    - E.g. of VCS: Mecurial, Git, Subversion

# Branch Dynamics in VCS

- There is a main branch or trunk
- Developers commit all new work to the trunk
- Developers create a release branch
- The trunk is copied to a release branch, and teams continue to work in parallel
- Branch is tagged and released
- Branch is maintained over time

# Release Management Process

- Creating a release management system
    - Create a checklist
    - Enforce the checklist
    - Standardise procedures across the organisation

# Release Preparation in VCS

- Through branches
    1. Create release branch
    2. Check out release branch
    3. Build and test release branch
    4. Create release distribution files
    5. Test distribution file contents
    6. Tag release
    7. Hand-off distribution file to QA

# Software Release Management Activities

- Distribution of software configuration item outside development activity
- Encompasses the identification, packaging, and delivery of the elements of the product release, e.g. executable program, documentation, release notes, configuration data
- Release management must consist of processes for internal (test team) or external (customer) releases
- Release management process must be designed to control a release that may consist of variants for different platforms

# Builds and Software Building

A build is the process of converting source code into standalone software artifacts (such as an executable programme to the customer or test team)
- Given a unique, often sequential ID
- Done of some regular basis (overnight, once a week)
- Comprises of a build list, which identifies all files and which revision of each to include in a build
- Correspond to a node in VCS graph

Each build must be
- Complete (self-sufficient)
- Repeatable (automatic, consistent)
- Informative (provides feedback)
- Schedulable (auto-triggered)
- Portable (independent of IDE)

# Release Distribution

- Manual approach
    - Physical media: CD's
    - Download from web page
- Automatic approach
    - Special software designed to eliminate the complicated installation and upgrade procedures -- deployment via java web start
    - Deployment and updates via the web, such as microsoft windows updates

# Build-Package-Deploy Configuration

- Source code repository - where the source code is stored
- Integration machine: Provide services to build/run/test source code
- Test server: Environment for test script to run
- Test script runner/load generator: Runs the test script
- Distribution server: Distributes built software

# Build-Package-Deploy Process

1. Checkout files
2. Prepare build directory
3. Compile 
4. Run unit tests
5. Package into JAR and WAR
6. Generate javadocs, release notes
7. Deploy in test environment
8. Run integration/system tests
9. Distribute

# Quality Management

- Quality means that a product should meet its specification and meet the customer's needs
- QA means the maintenance of a desired level of quaslity in a service or product, especially by means of attention to every stage of the process of delivery or production

# What is Project Quality?

The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) defineds quality as "the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirements"

Other experts define quality based on
- Conformance to requirements: Product satisfies specifications written for it
- Fitness for use: Product can be used as intended

# ISO 9126 Quality Model

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/627/1*ovjtYTtTnNYb_QWPQhut4A.png)

- Functionality: The capability of the software product to provide functions which meet stated andimplied needs when the software is used under specified conditions
- Reliability: The capability of the software product to maintain its level ofperformance under stated conditions for a stated period of time
- Usability: The capability of the software product to be understood, learned, used and attractive to the user, when used under specified conditions
- Maintainability: The capability of a software product to be modified. Modifications may include corrections, improvements or adaptations of software to changes in the environment and in the requirements and functional specifications
- Portability: The capability of the software product to be transferred from one environment to another. The environment may include organisation, hardware or software environments
- Efficiency: The capability of the software product to provide appropriate performance, relative to a number of resources used, under stated conditions

# Software Quality Management

- Concerned with ensuring that the requried level of quality is achieved in a software product
- Involves defining appropriate quality standards and procedures and ensuring that these are followed
- Aims to develop a 'quality culture' where quality is seen as everyone's responsibility

# Importance of Standards

- Encapsulation of best practice avoids repetition of past mistakes
- Standards are a framework for quality assurance processes - they involve checking compliance to standards
- They provide continuity - new staff can understand the organisation by understanding the standards that are used

# ISO 9000

- A set of international standards for quality management
- ISO 9001 applicable to organisations which design, develop and maintain products
- Applicable to a range of organisations from manufacturing to service industries
- ISO 9001 is a generic model of the quality process that must be instantiated for each organisation using the standard

## ISO 9000 Certification

- Quality standards and procedures should be documented in an organisational quality manual
- An external body may certify that an organisation's quality manual conforms to ISO 9000 standards
- Some customers require suppliers to be ISO 9000 certified although the need for flexibility here is increasingly recognised

# Quality Management

- Quality means that a product should meet its specification and meet the customer's needs
- QA means the maintenance of a desired level of quaslity in a service or product, especially by means of attention to every stage of the process of delivery or production

# What is Project Quality?

The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) defineds quality as "the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirements"

Other experts define quality based on
- Conformance to requirements: Product satisfies specifications written for it
- Fitness for use: Product can be used as intended

# McCall's Quality Model Triangle

# ISO 9126 Quality Model

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/627/1*ovjtYTtTnNYb_QWPQhut4A.png)

- Functionality: The capability of the software product to provide functions which meet stated andimplied needs when the software is used under specified conditions
- Reliability: The capability of the software product to maintain its level ofperformance under stated conditions for a stated period of time
- Usability: The capability of the software product to be understood, learned, used and attractive to the user, when used under specified conditions
- Maintainability: The capability of a software product to be modified. Modifications may include corrections, improvements or adaptations of software to changes in the environment and in the requirements and functional specifications
- Portability: The capability of the software product to be transferred from one environment to another. The environment may include organisation, hardware or software environments
- Efficiency: The capability of the software product to provide appropriate performance, relative to a number of resources used, under stated conditions

# Software Quality Management

- Concerned with ensuring that the requried level of quality is achieved in a software product
- Involves defining appropriate quality standards and procedures and ensuring that these are followed
- Aims to develop a 'quality culture' where quality is seen as everyone's responsibility

# Importance of Standards

- Encapsulation of best practice avoids repetition of past mistakes
- Standards are a framework for quality assurance processes - they involve checking compliance to standards
- They provide continuity - new staff can understand the organisation by understanding the standards that are used

# ISO 9000

- A set of international standards for quality management
- ISO 9001 applicable to organisations which design, develop and maintain products
- Applicable to a range of organisations from manufacturing to service industries
- ISO 9001 is a generic model of the quality process that must be instantiated for each organisation using the standard

## ISO 9000 Certification

- Quality standards and procedures should be documented in an organisational quality manual
- An external body may certify that an organisation's quality manual conforms to ISO 9000 standards
- Some customers require suppliers to be ISO 9000 certified although the need for flexibility here is increasingly recognised

# Quality Control

- This involves checking the software development process to ensure that procedures and standards are being followed
- 2 approaches to quality control
    - Quality reviews
    - Automated software assessment and software measurement

# Performing Quality Assurance

- Quality assurance includes all the activities related to satisfying the relevant quality standards for a project
- Benchmarking generates ideas for quality improvements by comparing specific project practices or product characteristics to those of other projects or products within or outside the performing organisation
- A quality audit is a structured review of specific quality management activities that help identify lessons learned that could improve performance on current or future projects

# Internal and External Attributes

- External attributes are properties of the software as a product that the user can enjoy
    - Maintainability
    - Reliability
    - Portability
    - Usability
- Internal attributes are all the properties of the software as seen by the developers that are desirable in order to facilitate the process of creating a good product
    - Number of procedure parameters
    - Cyclomatic complexity
    - Program size in lines of code
    - Number of error messages
    - Length of user manual

# Software Metrics

- Any type of measurement which relates to a osftware system, process or related documentation
- Lines of code in a program, the Fog index, number of person-days required to develop a component
- Allow the software and the software process to be quanitified
- May be used to predict product attributes or to control the software process
- Product metrics can be used for general predictions or to indentify anomalous components

Metrics that help in decision making include
- What is the quality of our product?
- Where are the bottlenecks in the process?
- WHen shall we stop testing?
- Where are the troublesome areas of the software?
- How can we predict the possible remaining defects?
- On which areas shall we focus our resources on?

Metrics have certain assumptions
- A software property is measurable
- The relationship exists between what we can measure, and what we want to know. We can only measure internal attributes, but are often more interested in external software attributes
- A quality metric should be a predictor of product quality

Common software metrics used include:
- Fan in/Fan-out
    - Fan-in is the number of functions or methods that call some other specific function X
    - Fan-out is the number of functions that is called by that specific function X
    - High fan-in means that X is tightly coupled to the rest of the design and changes in X may ripple out a lot
    - High fan-out value means that the overall complexity of X may be very high 
- Length of code
    - Measure of the size of the program
    - Larger programs are usually more complex and error-prone
- Cyclomatic complexity
    - A measure of control complexity of a program
    - Related to how many possible execution paths a program has
    - Related to program understandibility
- Length of identifiers
    - A measure of the average length of distinct identifiers in a program
    - Longer identifiers are more likely meaningful and help the program become more understandable
- Depth of conditional nesting
    - Depth of nested if-statement
    - Deeply nested if-statements are harder to understand, and error-prone
- Fog index
    - Average lengthof words and sentences in documents
    - Higher fog index means the document is harder to understand

Object-oriented metrics
- Depth of inheritance tree
    - Number of discrete levels in teh inheritance tree 
    - Deeper inheritance trees mean more complex designs
    - Many different object classes have to be understood to fully understand the object classes at the leaves of the inheritance tree
- Method fan-in/fan-out
    - Similar to fan-in/fan-out
- Weighted methods per class
    - Number of methods included in a class, weighted by the complexity of each method
    - The larger this value, the more likely the class is difficult to understand
- Number of overriding operations
    - Number of operations in a superclass that are overridden by a subclass
    - High value for this metric may indicate inheritance relationship is not appropriate

# Quality Assessment

Quality assessment includes
- Product assessment: Output of processes
- Process assessment: Tasks, activities and procedures that produce products
  
Quality assessment processes:
- Define quality assessment system (e.g. monthly review)
- Choose the right metrics to measure
- Collect data during project execution
- Analyse the data, conclude assessment results

# Quality Planning

- A quality plan sets out the desired product qualities and how these are assessed, and defines the most significant quality attributes
- The quality plan should define the quality assessment process
- The quality plan should set out which organisational standards should be applied, and where necessary, define new standards to be used


# Quality of Products/Process

1. Identify quality criteria
2. Define quality assessment process
3. Review quality of product/process
4. Improve quality of product and processes of the production

# Software Quality Assurance Plan

- Purpose, scope and quality objectives
- Reference documents/standards
- Organisational roles, responsibilites and assessment mechanisms
- Document standards/templates
- Standards, processes, practices, conventions and metrics
- Review and audit
- Others
    - Testing, reporting, training
    - Media control, supplier control, risk management

# Controlling Quality

The main outputs of quality control are
- Acceptance decisions
- Rework
- Process adjustments

There are 7 basic tools of quality that help in performing quality control

1. Cause and effect diagram
    - Trace complaints about quality problems back to the responsible production operation
    - Helps to find root cause of the problem
    - Also konwn as fishbone or ishikawa diagrams

    ![Cause and effect diagram](https://www.spcforexcel.com/files/images/fishbone1.gif)

2. Quality Control Charts
    - A control chart is a graphic display of data that illustrates the results of a process over time
    - Main use of control charts is to prevent defects rather than to detect or reject them
    - Quality control charts allow you to determine whether a process is in or out of control
        - When a process is in control, any variations in the results of the process are created by random events; processes that are in control do not need to be adjusted
        - When a process is out of control, variations in the results of the process are caused by non-random events. Must identify the causes of those non-random events and adjust processes accordingly to correct or eliminate them
    - 7 run rule: use quality control charts and the seven run rule to look for patterns in data
        - Seven run rule states that if seven data points in a row are all below the mean, above the mean, or are all increasing/decreasing, then the process needs to be examined for non-random problems

3. Checksheet
    - Used to collect and analyse data

    ![Checksheet](https://d3tl80hy6t5toy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/09/06052019/Classification-Check-sheet1.png)

4. Scatter Diagram

    ![Scatter diagram for quality control](https://www.presentationeze.com/wp-content/uploads/Slide232-39.jpg)

5. Histograms
    - A bar graph of a distribution of values
    - Each bar represents an attribute or characteristic of a problem or situation, and the height represents the frequency
    ![Histogram](https://www.slideteam.net/media/catalog/product/cache/1280x720/q/u/quality_control_tools_and_techniques_powerpoint_presentation_slides_Slide15.jpg)

6. Pareto Charts
    - A Pareto chart is a histogram that can help identify and prioritise problem areas
    - Pareto analysis is also called the 80-20 rule, meaning that 80% of the problems are often due to 20% of the causes

    ![Pareto Chart](https://cdn.brandfolder.io/GDDASP4K/at/qbj6ckvjjp7jp6hw388h4m6x/pareto_chart.jpg)

7. Flowcharts
    - Graphic displays of logic and flow of processes that help analyse how problems occur and how processes can be improved
    - Show activities, decision points and the order of how information is processed

    ![Flowchart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/LampFlowchart.svg/1200px-LampFlowchart.svg.png)

    - In addition to flowcharts, run charts are also used for stratification, a technique that shows data from a variety of sources tto see if a pattern emerges
    - A run chart displays the history and pattern of variation of a process over time

    ![Run chart](https://d3tl80hy6t5toy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/09/06052000/Run-Chart-table-ex2.png)

# Statistical Sampling

- Statistical sampling involves choosing part of a population of interest for inspection
- Size of sample depends on how representative you want the sample to be

# Six Sigma

- A comprehensive and flexible system for achieving, sustaining and maximising business success. Six sigma is uniquely driven by close understanding of customer needs, disciplined use of facts, data, and statistical analysis, and diligent attention to managing, improving and reinventing business practices
- The target for perfection is the achievement of no more than 3.4 defects per million opportunities
- Six Sigma projects normally follow a five-phase improvement process called DMAIC

## DMAIC

- A systematic closed-loop process for continued improvement that is scientific and fact based
- DMAIC stands for
    - Define: Define problem/opportunity, process and customer requirements
    - Measure: Define measures and then collect, compile and display data
    - Analyse: Scrutinize process details to find improvement for opportunities
    - Improve: Generate solutions and ideas for improving problem
    - Control: Track and verify stability of the improvements and the predictability of the solution

# The Cost of Quality

- The cost of quality is the cost of conformance plus the cost of nonconformance
    - Conformance means delivering products that meet the requirements and fitness for use
    - Cost of nonconformance refers to taking responsibility for failures or not meeting quality expectations

Five cost categories related to quality

1. Prevention cost: Cost of planning and executing a project so it is error-free or within an acceptable error range
2. Appraisal cost: Cost of evaluation processes and their outputs to ensure quality
3. Internal failure cost: Cost incurred to correct an identified defect before customer receives the product
4. External failure cost: Cost that relates to all the errors not detected and corrected before delivery to the customer
5. Measurements and test equipment costs: Capital cost of equipment used to perform prevention and appraisal activities

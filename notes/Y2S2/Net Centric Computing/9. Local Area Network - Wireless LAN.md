# Wireless LAN

- Wired LANs are limited due to physical, hard-wired infrastructure
- Wireless LANs
    - Flexibility
    - Portability
    - Mobility
    - Ease of installation

# Characteristics of Wireless LANs

- Advantages
    - Flexible deployment
    - Minimal wiring difficulties
    - More robust against disasters (such as earthquakes)
- Disadvantages
    - Low bandwidth compared to wired solutions
    - Proprietary solutions
    - Need to follow wireless spectrum regulation

# Wireless Link Characteristics

- Different from wired link
    - Decreased signal strength: Radio signal attenuates as it passes through matter (path loss)
    - Interference from other sources: Standardised wireless frequencies shared by other devices
    - Multipath propagation: Radio signals reflect off objects, arriving at the destination in slightly different timings

# WLAN Architecture

- Building Modules
    - Station (STA)
        - ![Station](https://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/station-1.png)
        - A station is a device that has access to WiFi and allows transmission and reception of data. 
        - Both the ends of data sharing is called as a station. 
        - The station is where data starts while transmission and data reach while receiving:
        - Mobile node, smartphone, pad, laptop
    - Access Point (AP)
        - ![Access Point](https://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/access-point.png)
        - An access point is used to connect a wired network to a wireless one.
        - Stations are connected to access points

2 architectural modes
- Infrastructure: Centralized
    - In infrastructure mode, all devices on a wireless network communicate with each other through an access point (wireless router)
- Ad hoc: Distributed
    - A computer with wireless adapter communicates directly with a printer equipped with a wireless print server

# 802.11 Protocol Stack

# Wireless Physical Layer

## Radio Spectrum

- Radio frequency bands are allocated to different applications
    - The use of most frequency bands needs licenses
    - IEEE 802.11 uses industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands that don't require licenses if the radio transmissions follow national/global regulations
    - 802.11 uses 2.4GHz and 5GHz

# 802.11 MAC Sublayer

- New challenges caused by the nature of wireless communications
    - Broadcast
    - Signal attenuation
    - Pervasive electromagnetic noise
- Three functional areas
    - Access control (random access vs controlled access)
    - Reliable data delivery (against noises and collisions)
    - Security (authentication, packet injection)
- Two additional problems
    - Hidden terminal problem
    - Exposed terminal problem

# Access Control

- Distributed coordination function (DCF)
    - Distributed access protocol
    - Contention based
    - Makes use of CSMA/CA (Carrier sense multiple access, collision avoidance)
    - Suitable for ad-hoc network and asynchronous traffic
- Point coordination function (PCF)
    - Alternative access method on top of DCF
    - Centralised access protocol
    - Contention-free, and works like polling
    - Suited for time-bound services like voice and multimedia

# Reliable Data Delivery

- Loss of frames due to noise, interference and propagation effects
- Frame exchange protocol
    - Sender broadcasts data
    - Receiver responds with acknowledgment (ACK)
    - If sender does not receive ACK, sender retransmits frame
- 4 frame exchange for enhanced reliability
    - Sender issues request-to-send (RTS)
    - Receiver responds with clear-to-send (CTS)
    - Sender transmits data
    - Receiver responds with ACK

# 802.11 Multi-Access

- Collision
    - A receiver hears transmissions from 2 or more nodes at the same time
- 802.11: CSMA - sense before transmitting
    - Don't collide with ongoing transmission by other node
- 802.11: No collision detection
    - Difficult to receive (sense collisions) when transmitting due to weak received signals (fading)
    - Can't sense all carriers and colisions in any case: Hidden terminal problem
- 802.11: Avoid collisions
    - CSMA/CA (Carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance)

## Hidden Node Problem

![Hidden Node problem](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles-Perkins-2/publication/220134463/figure/fig1/AS:349560200286209@1460353054300/Hidden-terminal-problem.png)

- 2 nodes A and B are transmitting to the access point
- However, A and B cannot see each other due to limited range - They are hidden from each other
- Limited range can be caused by
    - Barrier
    - Signal attenuation
- Ethernet does not have the hidden terminal problem

# Collision Avoidance

- Idea: Sender to "reserve" channel for a long data frame
    - Sender first transmits a small "request-to-send" (RTS) packet to receiver with CSMA
        - RTSs may still collide with each other, or an RTS may collide with an ongoing data frame
        - But they are short enough to not be a major problem
    - Receiver broadcasts clear-to-send (CTS) in response to RTS
    - CTS is heard by all nodes
        - Sender transmits data frame
        - Other stations defer transmissions

# Exposed Terminal Problem

![Exposed terminal problem](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/R-Shyamasundar/publication/221053189/figure/fig2/AS:640988259315713@1529834918175/Exposed-Terminal-Problem.png)

    - Sleeping without missing any messages
    - Power management functions

# Multi-Access Reservation Protocol (MARP)

- Two-phase protocol
    - Phase 1: Channel reservation
    - Phase 2: Data transmission

```
while channel is busy:
    check if channel is free

transmit data frame
```

How many reservation trial frames?
- Assume that the channel utilisation in reservation phase: $S_r$
- Number of reservation trial frames to reserve the channel $X$
    - $X = 1$: First trial succeeds, probability $S_r$
    - $X = k$: First $k-1$ trials fail, the $k$th trial succeeds with probability $S_r (1 - S)_r^{k - 1}$
    - This is a geometric distribution, $E(x) = 1 / S_r$
    - The average transmission window $u + v / S_r$ units of time

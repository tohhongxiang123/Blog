# Wireless LAN

- Wired LANs are limited due to physical, hard-wired infrastructure
- Wireless LANs
    - Flexibility
    - Portability
    - Mobility
    - Ease of installation

# Characteristics of Wireless LANs

- Advantages
    - Flexible deployment
    - Minimal wiring difficulties
    - More robust against disasters (such as earthquakes)
- Disadvantages
    - Low bandwidth compared to wired solutions
    - Proprietary solutions
    - Need to follow wireless spectrum regulation

# Wireless Link Characteristics

- Different from wired link
    - Decreased signal strength: Radio signal attenuates as it passes through matter (path loss)
    - Interference from other sources: Standardised wireless frequencies shared by other devices
    - Multipath propagation: Radio signals reflect off objects, arriving at the destination in slightly different timings

# WLAN Architecture

- Building Modules
    - Station (STA)
        - ![Station](https://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/station-1.png)
        - A station is a device that has access to WiFi and allows transmission and reception of data. 
        - Both the ends of data sharing is called as a station. 
        - The station is where data starts while transmission and data reach while receiving:
        - Mobile node, smartphone, pad, laptop
    - Access Point (AP)
        - ![Access Point](https://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/06/access-point.png)
        - An access point is used to connect a wired network to a wireless one.
        - Stations are connected to access points

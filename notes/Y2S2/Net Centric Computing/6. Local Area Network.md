# Local Area Network

- LAN is a computer network that covers a small area (home, office, buildings, campus)
- LANs have higher data rates (10Mbps to 40 Gbps) as compared to WANs
- LANs usually do not involve leased lines; cabelling and equipments belong to the LAN owner
- LAN consists of
  - Shared transmission medium
  - Regulations for orderly access to the medium Set of hardware and software for the interfacing device

# LAN Protocol Architecture

- Corresponds to the lower 2 layers of OSI model (Datalink and physical)
  - However, LANS mostly do not follow OSI model
- Current LANs are most likely to be based on Ethernet protocols developed by IEEE 802 committee
  - Logical Link Control (LLC)
  - Media Access Control (MAC)
  - Physical

## IEEE 802 Layers

1. Physical

   - Signal encoding/decoding
   - Preamble generation/removal
     - For synchronisation
   - Bit tranmission/reception
   - Specification for topology and transmission medium
   - Wifi vs LiFi

2. DLL
   - OSI Layer 2 (Data Link) is divided into 2 in IEEE802
   - Logical Link Control (LLC) and Medium Access Control (MAC)
   - LLC Layer
     - Interface to higher levels
     - Flow control
     - Based on classical Data Link Control Protocols (covered earlier in flow control)
   - MAC Layer
     - Prepare data for transmission
     - Error detection
     - Address recognition
     - Govern access to transmission medium
       - Not found in traditional layer 2 data link control

# LAN Topologies

## Bus and Tree

![Bus topology](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/A-bus-network-topology.png)

- Multipoint medium
- Transmission propagates throughout medium
- Heard by all stations
  - Need to identify target station
    - Each station has unique address
- Full duplex connection between station and tap
  - Allows for transmission and reception
- Need to regulate transmission
  - To avoid collision
    - If 2 stations transmit information at the same time, signals overlap
  - To avoid continuous transmission from a single station, stations transmit data in small blocks - frames
- Terminator absorbs frames at the end of the medium

## Ring Topology

![Ring Topology](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200526102238/Untitled-Diagram-153-1.png)

- Repeaters are joined by point to point links in a closed loop
  - Receive data on one link, retransmit on another
  - Links are unidirectional
  - Stations are attached to repeaters
- Data Frames
  - Circulate past all stations
  - Destination recognises address and copies frame
  - Frame circulates from source, around the ring, and back to the source, where it is removed
- Medium access control determines when a station can insert a frame into the ring

## Star Topology

![Star Topology](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200522154756/Star-Topology.png)

- Each station connected directly to the central node
  - Using a full-duplex link
- Central node can broadcast (hub)
  - Physical star, but logically like bus since broadcast
  - Only one station can transmit at a time, otherwise, collision occurs
- Central node can act as a frame switch
  - Retransmit only to destination

# Choice of Topology

- Reliability
- Expandability
- Performance
- Needs considering in context of
  - Medium
  - Wiring layout
  - Access control

# Transmission Medium

- Voice grade unshielded twisted pair (UTP)
  - Cat3/Cheap
  - Well understood
  - Use existing telephone wiring in office building
  - Low data rates
- Shielded twisted pair (STP) and baseband coaxial
  - More expensive than UTP, but higher data rate
- Broadband cable
  - Still more expensive, and higher data rate
- High performance UTP
  - Cat 5 and above (5e and 6)
  - High data rate for small number of devices
  - Switched star topology for large installations
- Optical fiber
  - Electromagnetic isolation
  - High capacity
  - Small size
  - High component cost
  - High skill required to install and maintain
- Wireless Channel
  - Fading channel

# Media Access Control (MAC)

- Assembly of data into frames with address and error detection fields
- Disassemble of frame
  - Address recognition
  - Error detection
- Govern access to transmission medium
  - Not found in traditional layer 2 data link control
- For the same LLC, several MAC options may be available

## MAC Decision Making Options

- Where?
  - Central
    - Greater control
    - Simple access logic at station
    - Avoids problem of coordination
    - Single point of failure
    - Potentional Bottleneck
  - Distributed
- How?
  - Synchronous (static) solutions
    - Specify capacity dedicated to connection
  - Asynchronous (dynamic) solutions
    - In response to demand

### Static Channel Allocation

- Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
  - Each user is statically allocated one time slot
  - If a particular user does not have anything to send, that period is wasted
  - User may not utilise the whole channel for a time slot
- Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
  - Channel is divided to carry different signals at different frequencies
  - Efficient if there is a constant (one for each slot) amount of users with continuous traffic
- Code Division Multiplexing (CDM)
  - Multiple users share the same channel
  - Each user in a channel is given a code
  - When the user wants to transmit data through the channel, the user takes its own signal and multiplies it with his own code, and then broadcasts the signal on the channel
  - When another user wants to receive the data from the channel, this other user will take the overall signal and multiply it with the code of the station he wants to listen to. This isolates the message from the channel, and the user can now decipher the message that was sent

### Dynamic Channel Allocation

- Round robin
  - Each station has a turn to transmit
    - Declines or transmits up to a certain data limit
    - Overhead of passing the turn in either case
  - Performs well if many stations have data to transmit most of the time
    - Otherwise, passing the turn would cause inefficiency
- Reservation
  - Used for stream traffic, where time on the medium is divided into slots, much as with TDM
  - Reservation can be made in centralised or distributed fashion
- Contention
  - All stations contend to transmit
  - No control to determine whose turn it is
  - Stations send data by taking risk of collision with other packets
    - However, stations understand collisions by listening to the channel, so that they can retransmit their own data
  - Several implementation methods such as Aloha, CSMA etc.
  - In general, good for bursty traffic
    - Typical traffic types for most networks
  - Efficient under light or moderate load
  - Performs badly under heavy load

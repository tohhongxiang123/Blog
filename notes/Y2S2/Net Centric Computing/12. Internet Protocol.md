# Internet Protocol

Network Taxonomy
- Switched networks
    - Circuit switched networks, such as telephone networks
        - A dedicated circuit guarantees full bandwidth for the sender and the receiver
    - Packet-switched networks
        - Datagram networks, such as IP networks
            - Transmission begins without establishing a path first. 
            - Data is split into packets, and then each packet finds their own route from the sender to the receiver. Data does not have to arrive in sequence, but will be reassembled into sequence when they arrive at their destinations
            - Sender needs to append a header containing the destination address so that the intermediate packet-switched nodes know how to send it to the destination
            - Packet-switched nodes are shared with others for transmission (efficient usage of resources)
        - Virtual-circuit networks, such as X.25
            - Before sending the packets, the network will find the "best" path for the packets. Once a path is found, all the packets will be sent in order, following the same path to the destination

We will be focusing on datagram networks, because the Internet Protocol uses datagram networks

# Characteristics of Internet Protocol

- 2 basic protocol functions
    - Addressing
    - Fragmentation
- Provides a connectionless unreliable best-effort (datagram) service
    - Connectionless: Each packet is handled independently, no flow control
    - Unreliable: No error control
    - Best-effort: No throughput guarantee, no delay guarantee, no Quality of Service (QoS) guarantee

The IP header, specifically IPv4 is designed as follows (RFC 791)
- Header: 20 - 60 bytes
    - VER: 4 bits, IP version field, set to 4 for IPv4 
    - HLEN: 4 bits: Internet header length, the number of 32-bit words that make up the header field. The minimum available number is 5 (32 * 5 / 8 = 20), as the first 20 bytes are mandatory
    - Service: 8 bits: Type of service (for differentiated services), such as voice-over IP
    - Total length: 16 bits: Total size of datagram, including header and data parts. Max size is $2^16 = 65536$ bytes
    - Identification: 16 bits: Used to indicate a group of fragments if the datagram is fragmented
    - Flags: 3 bits: Different combinations of the flags control fragmentation and indicate fragmented datagrams
    - Fragmentation offset: 13 bits: Offset of a fragmented packet
    - Time to live: 8 bits: Number of hops a packet lives. Each router decrements this field. If 0, the packet is discarded. Used to eliminate looping packets
    - Protocol: 8 bits: Protocol used in the data part, such as 0x01 for ICMP, 0x06 for TCP, 0x11 for UDP
    - Header checksum: 16 bits: Checksum for error detection, covering only the header field
    - Source IP address: 32 bits
    - Destination IP address: 32 bits
- Data: Header + Data is 20 - 65535 bytes

## Classes of IP address

| Class | Leading bits | Size of network number bit field | Size of rest bit field | Number of networks | Addresses per network | Start address | End address     |
| ----- | ------------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| A     | 0            | 8                                | 24                     | 2^7                | 2^24                  | 0.0.0.0       | 127.255.255.255 |
| B     | 10           | 16                               | 16                     | 2^14               | 2^16                  | 128.0.0.0     | 191.255.255.255 |
| C     | 110          | 24                               | 8                      | 2^21               | 2^8                   | 192.0.0.0     | 223.255.255.255 |


## IPv4 Address: Special Use (RFC 5735)

An address assigned to the host/router's interface
- An interface is a connection between the host/router and the physical link
- A network (from the IP address perspective)
    - Device interfaces with same network id of IP address
    - Can physically reach each other without intermediate router

- Network and/or host id - All '0's (can only be used as a source address; e.g. during startup to get own IP in DHCP)
    - 0.0.0.0 : the host on this network
    - 155.69.0.0 : The network/subnet ID
- Network and/or host id - All '1's: (can only be used as a destination address)
    - 255.255.255.255 : limited broadcast within this network (ARP)
    - 155.69.255.255 : directed broadcast on 155.69.xx.xx netweork
- Loopback address (127.x.y.z)
    - Internal loopback to the same host
    - Useful for self-testing of network software
    - E.g. localhost: 127.0.0.1

## Subnetting (RFC 950)

Subnetting is partitioning a single large network into smaller networks called subnets
- Subnetting is used for easier management
- Subnets make networks more efficient, as network traffic can travel a shorter distance without passing through unnecessary routers to reach its destination

Subnetting is done by adding another level of hierarchy to the IP address structure
- Initially, we had network prefix, host number
- Now, we have network prefix, subnet number, and host number
    - The network prefix + subnet number is the "extended network prefix" for a subnet

Note that
- Subnets are only visible within the organisation
- Hence, organisation is free to decide the number of bits for subnet and host numbers
- Externally, the organisation network is still viewed as a single, large network

### Subnet Masks

- To indicate the length of the extended network prefix, we use a subnet mask w.x.y.z (bits corresponding to extended network prefix are set to 1's, otherwise set to 0)
- For example, 
    - Consider a network address 166.113.0.0 with 5 subnet ID bits
    - 166 = 1010 0110, hence this is a class B network
    - We know that the first 16 bits of the network address is the network identifier, while 5 more bits are the subnet ID bits
    - Hence, the subnet mask is 11111111 11111111 11111000 00000000 (255.255.248.0)
    - We usually use a "slash notation" (a.b.c.d/x) where x indicates the number of bits for the extended network prefix
    - Consider the subnet address 166.113.8.0/21
        - We know our network prefix has 21 bits, hence we use the subnet mask 255.255.248.0
        - Doing a logical AND between the subnet address and subnet mask, we get the network ID (166.113.8.0)
        - The subnet addresses range from 166.113.8.0 - 166.113.15.255
- Subnet masks are usually used during the setting up of communication, to determine if the source and destination are in the same subnet

### Subnet Broadcasting

- A subnet broadcast address is when the host address is set to all 1s
    - E.g. consider a class B address 166.113.0.0/21
    - This has a subnet mask of 255.255.248.0
    - Then 166.113.15.255 refers to a broadcast to the subnet 166.113.8.0/21

```
10100110 1110001 00001111 00000000
11111111 1111111 11111000 00000000

10100110 1110001 00001000 00000000 (Masked)
10100110 1110001 00001111 11111111 (166.113.15.255, broadcast)
```

- All subnet broadcast (set subnet and host address to all 1's)
    - Note that the first 16 bits is the network address
    - The next 5 bits refers to the subnet
    - The remaining 11 bits refers to the host
    - 166.113.255.255 means broadcast to all hosts in all subnets under 166.113

# IP Routing Protocol

# Router

- A router is a device used to interconnect networks, and to forward packets by examining the destination address in the IP header of each packet
- A router decides which path to forward to using a **routing protocol**, used to initialise/update the routing table so that a route/path can be determined

# Routing: Flooding

![Flooding](https://networklessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/multicast-dense-mode-pruning.png)

- A straightforward way of routing
- When a node receives a packet, it will forward the packet to all other links except the incoming link
- The packet will be labelled with a unique identifier
- Should the same packet return, the packet will be discarded

Advantages
- A packet will always get through if one or more paths exist (very robust)

Disadvantages
- Wasteful of bandwidth, may cause serious congestion, hence not used in the internet

Applications of flooding:
- Military applications (routers may be destroyed anytime)
- Ad hoc wireless networks (nodes may be turned off or moved away anytime)

# Routing in the Internet

- For routing purposes, the internet is divided into Autonomous Systems (AS)
- An AS is a group of routers under the authority of a single administration; e.g. an Internet Service Provider
- Each AS is uniquely identified by a 2 byte (0 - 65535) or 4 byte (65536 - 4294967295) ASN (Autonomous Service Number), which is assigned by IANA
- E.g. ASN of NTU: AS9419
- You can check the ASN of a particular company on [www.ultratools.com](https://www.ultratools.com)

# Intra-AS and Inter-AS Routing

![inter vs intra as routing](https://images.slideplayer.com/34/10201874/slides/slide_2.jpg)
- In practice, routing in Internet is done in a hierarchical manner, which includes intra- and inter-AS routings

Intra-AS Routing
- Routing within an AS
- Protocols for Intra-AS routing are also called Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs)
- Different AS can choose to run their preferred protocols
- E.g. Intra-AS Routers: 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d in AS1

Inter-AS Routing
- Routing between AS
- Protocols for Inter-AS routing are also called Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs)
- All AS must run the same standard protocol
- E.g. Inter-AS routers: 1b, 2a, 1c, 3a

# Why is there a difference?

- Policy: 
    - Inter-AS: Different admin wants control over how its traffic are forwarded, who routes through its network etc.
    - Intra-AS: Single admin, so no policy decision needed
- Performance
    - Intra-AS: Can focus on performance
    - Inter-AS: Policy may dominate over performance
- Scale:
    - Internet is too large to be treated as a single routing domain

# Intra-AS Routing: Distance Vector Routing

- Distance Vector routing, or Bellman-Ford routing, or old ARPANET routing
- Consists of 3 main stages
    1. Discover neighbors by multicasting request
    2. Exchange distance vectors (routing information) with immediate neighbors only
        - Response to request
        - Periodic updates (Typically 30s intervals)
        - Triggered updates due to changes
    3. Compute shortest-path routes (using Bellman-Ford algorithm)

# Intra-AS Routing: Routing Information Protocol

- RIP uses distance vector algorithm, cost is simply based on the number of hops
- Allows maximum of 15 hops, 16 hops indicate %\infty$
- Routing information is exchanged every 30 seconds via Response Message
- If no advertisement is heard after 180 seconds, the neighbor/link is declared dead

# Intra-AS Routing: Link State Routing

Consists of 5 stages
1. Discover neighbors by multicasting Hello
    - Link A transmits HELLO packet on each of its links
    - A's neighbors identify themselves to A
2. Construct Link State Advertisement Packet (LSA/LSP)
    - LSA/LSP contain information of itself, and its immediate neighbors only
    - E.g. R1 link-state: 
        - Connected to neighbor R2 on network 10.2.0.0/16, cost of 20
        - Connected to neighbor R3 on network 10.3.0.0/16, cost of 5
        - Connected to neighbor R4 on network 10.4.0.0/16, cost of 20
        - Has a network 10.1.0.0/16, cost of 2
3. Flood LSA/LSP to all routers
    - During initial startup
    - When there is a change in topology
4. Construct Link State Database
    - Each router builds its own link state database, to have a complete topology of the whole network
    - E.g. R1 Link-states: 
        - Connected to neighbor R2 on network 10.2.0.0/16, cost of 20
        - Connected to neighbor R3 on network 10.3.0.0/16, cost of 5
        - Connected to neighbor R4 on network 10.4.0.0/16, cost of 20
        - Has a network 10.1.0.0/16, cost of 2
    - LSPs from R2:
        - Connected to R1 on network 10.2.0.0/16, cost of 20
        - Connecteed to R5 on network 10.9.0.0/16, cost of 10
        - Has network 10.5.0.0/16, cost of 2
5. Compute Shortest-Path Routes (using Dijkstra's algorithm)
    - Finds the shortest distance from a router, to all other routers   
    - Routing table is updated with cost to the node, and the next node to go to to reach that node

# Intra-AS Link State Routing: Open Shortest Path First

- Open: Publicly available
- Uses Link State algorithm
    - LSA packet dissemination
    - Topology map at each node
    - Route computation using Dijkstra's algorithm
- Advertisements disseminated to entire AS (via flooding)

# Inter-AS Path Vector Routing: Border Gateway Protocol

Consists of 3 main stages
1. Configure border router to know its neighbors
2. Exchange path vectors (routing information) with neighbors
3. Select path based on policy

BGP is the de facto standard, currently on version 4 (RFC 4271)
- Note: After configuration, BGP routers establish TCP connections with their neighbors to exchange routing information

Protocol design principles:
- Scalable: Backbone AS must be able to find the destination
- Loop free
- AUtonomy of AS routing policy

Broadly, AS can be classified into stub AS, multi-homed AS or transit AS
- Transit AS: Connected to other AS to carry transit traffic for its customers; mainly the providers, i.e. ISPs
- Stub AS: Connected to only 1 other AS; typically the customer connected to its provider. In fact, it's not necessary for stub AS to run BGP since it has only 1 path to its ISP
- Multi-homed AS: Connected to more than 1 AS, but does not carry transit traffic; typically for customers requiring reliability

Configuring BGP routers to know their neighbors (peers) to establish TCP connections
- External peers (between different AS) are normally adjacent to each other and share a subnet
- Internal peers may be in any subnet within the same AS

There is also the commercial relationship between neighboring ASes
- Customer-Provider: Customer pays the provider to send and receive traffic
    - E.g. NTU and Singtel
- Peer-to-peer: Two ASes agree to transmit traffic to each other
    - E.g. SingAREN and AARnet
    
Based on policy, BGP routers can decide to accept/decline offered paths; and to drop/advertise paths to their neigbors
- Path selection (policy based)
    - Import policy: May or may not select path offered
        - E.g. cost, business relationship, don't route through competitors, loop prevention reaons
    - Export policy: Can filter routes you don't want to tell neighbors
        - E.g. don't want to route traffic to Z -> don't advertise any routes to Z

# Network Layers

-   Networks are complex with many pieces
    -   Hosts, routers, links, hardware, software, protocols etc
-   Dealing with complex systems
    -   Explicit structures allow identification, relationship of different pieces
    -   Modularisation easing maintenance and updating
        -   Change of a layer's service transparent to the rest of the system
        -   Change in network technology does not affect the rest of the system
    -   Layering harmful? (Design vs Implementation)

For example,

-   Browser requests web page from the server
-   Server determines if access is granted
-   Reliable transfer page from server to client
-   Physical transfer of bits from server to client

> There must be a standardised interface between systems to allow communication in between systems, regardless of the details of the system

# Layered Network Architecture

-   Network organised as a stack of layers
    -   Purpose of layers is to offer services to the layer above it and passes data and control information to the layer below, using a well-defined interface
    -   Redcuces design complexity
-   Protocols: A set of rules governing communication between two peering parties or computers
    -   Define format, order of messages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on message transmission and receipt
-   Network architecture: A set of layers and protocols with specifications enabling hardware/software developers to build systems compliant with a particular architecture

## Benefits of Layers

-   Simplicity
    -   Easy to design once layers and their interactions are defined clearly
-   Flexibility
    -   Easy to modify and develop networks by separate layer modifications
-   Incremental Changes
    -   Easy to add new layers, or new functions to layers

## Open System Interconnection (OSI)-7-Layer Model

![Layers in OSI-7-Layer Model](https://www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2020/02/OSI-7-layers.jpg)

-   Data
    -   Application: Network process to application
    -   Presentation: Data representation, encryption and decription, convert machine dependent data to machine independent data
    -   Session: Inter-host communication, managing sesions between applications
-   Segment
    -   Transport: End-to-end connections, reliability and flow control
-   Packet
    -   Network: Path determination and logical addressing
-   Frame
    -   Data link: Physical addressing
-   Bit
    -   Physical: Media signal and binary transmission

### Layers within OSI-7-Layer Model

1. Application
    - Used by network applications (Computer applications that use the internet, such as web browsers)
    - Uses application layer protocols such as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), HTTP Secure, etc. to perform activities
    - File Transfer Protocol (FTP) used to transfer files
    - HTTP/S used to do web surfing
    - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) used for emails
2. Presentation
    - Receives data from application layer
    - Performs **translation**, **data compression**, and **encryption**
    - Translation
        - Data is in the form of characters and numbers from the application layer, and presentation layer converts this data into machine-readable binary code
    - Data compression
        - Presentation layer also reduces the number of bits required to represent data
        - Compression can be lossy or lossless
    - Encryption
        - To maintain integrity of data, data is encrypted using the secure socket layer (SSL) protocol
        - This enhances the security of the data
        - When receiving data, presentation layer decrypts the data instead under SSL protocol
3. Session
    - Helps in **setting up** and **managing** a connection, and **termination** of session
    - Also helps in **authentication** (Checking who you are) and **authorisation** (Checking whether you are allowed to access the data)
    - Uses Application Programming Interface (API) to allow applications on different computers to communicate with one another
4. Transport
    - Controls the reliability of communication through **segmentation**, **flow control** and **error control**
    - Also involved in connection and connectionless transmission
    - Segmentation
        - Data received from session layer is divided into data units called "segments"
        - Each segment contains source and destination port number, and a sequence number
        - Port numbers help direct the data to the correct application
        - Sequence numbers help the application to reorder the data in the correct order, in case it arrives out of sequence
    - Flow control
        - Controls the amount of data being transmitted
        - Different devices have different data transmission rates
        - If transmission rates do not match, devices can communicate to tell the other device to slow down or speed up transmission, to prevent data loss
    - Error control
        - If a data unit does not get received, an automatic repeat request is used to retransmit the loss or corrupted data
        - A group of bits called a "checksum" is added to each data unit by the transport layer. When receiving, the receiver ensures that the checksum is correct. If it is incorrect, an automatic repeat request is used
    - Protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
        - UDP is faster than TCP, but UDP provides no feedback
        - UDP is used where full data transmission is not necessary, e.g. for movie streaming
        - TCP is used where full data transmission is necessary, e.g. emailing
5. Network Layer
    - Used to transfer data between systems on different networks
    - Data units in the network layer are called "packets"
    - It is the layer where routers reside
    - In charge of **logical addressing**, **path determination** and **routing**
    - Logical addressing
        - Every computer in the network has a unique IP address
        - Every packet is assigned the sender's and receiver's IP address, to ensure each packet arrives at the correct destination
    - Routing
        - Moving packets from their origin to their destination
    - Path determination
        - Networks can be connected to each other, and not directly
        - Data should travel the shortest path from the source to the destination
        - Uses protocols such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
6. Data Link Layer
    - Receives data packet from network layer
    - In charge of framing
        - Breaks up packets into frames and sends them from source to destination
        - Also reassembles frames when receiving them
    - Layer is made up of 2 parts
    - Logical Link Control (LLC)
        - Identifies network protocols, performs error checking and synchronises frames
    - Media Access Control (MAC)
        - Uses MAC addresses to connect to the correct device, and define permissions to transmit/receive data
7. Physical Layer
    - In charge of converting the received data from the previous layers into signals depending on medium
        - Electrical signals for wire, light signals for optical cables, and radio signals for air

### Benefits of OSI-7-Layer Model

-   Functional Decomposition
    -   Weakly-decoupled stack
-   Encapsulation
    -   Each layer adding new headers
-   Peering
    -   Only peer layer (the layer on top and on the bottom) communicating with each other

### OSI in Action: Encapsulation

-   A message begins at the top application layer and moves down the OSI layers to the bottom physical layer
-   As the message descends, each successive OSI model layers adds a header to it
-   A header is layer-specific information that basically explains what functions the layer carries out
-   Conversely at the receiving end, headers are stripped from the message as it travels up the OSI layers

### OSI Unified View: Protocols

-   Layer n in one machine interacts with layer n in another machine to provide a service to layer n + 1
-   The entities comprising the corresponding layers on different machines are called peer processes
-   The machines use a set of rules and conventions called the layer-n protocol
-   Layer-n peer processes communicate by exchanging protocol data units (PDUs)

### OSI Unified View: Services

-   Communication between peer processes is virtual and indirect
-   Layer n + 1 transfers information by invoking the services provided by layer n
-   Services are available at service access points (SAPs)
-   Each layer passes data and control information to the layer below it until the physical layer is reached, and transfer occurs
-   The data passed to the layer below is called a service data unit (SDU)
-   SDUs are encapsulated in PDUs

## TCP/IP Internetworking

![TCP/IP](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18752_01/html/816-4554/figures/ipov.fig88.png)

Another layered model for network communication. Contains 5 layers

1. Application: Supporting network application protocols such as FTP, SMTP, HTTP
2. Transport
    - Host-to-host data transfer, supports protocols such as TCP and UDP
    - Ensure packets arrive in sequence and without errors
3. Internet (also known as Network)
    - Routing of datagrams from source to destination - IP, routing protocols
    - Accepts and delivers packets for the network
4. Data Link
    - Identifies the network protocol type of the packet
    - Provides error control and framing as well
5. Physical
    - Specifies the characteristics of the hardware used for the network

At the sender, each layer takes data from above

-   Each layer adds header information to create a new data unit
-   Each layer then passes the new data unit to the layer below

At the receiver, data is unwrapped from the last layer

-   Each layer removes the header information from the corresponding data unit
-   Then each layer passes the new data unit to the layer above, until the original message is received

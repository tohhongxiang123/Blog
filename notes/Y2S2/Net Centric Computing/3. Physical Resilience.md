# Physical Resilience

Physical resilience of network lines are important, so that computers can continue communicating with one another

- The probability that a network performs satisfactorily over a period of time
- Parameters
  - Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)
  - Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)
  - Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
  - MTBF = MTTF + MTTR

# Link Failure Probability

- Link Failure Probability: Percentage of time during which the link is dysfunctional
- Link Availability: Percentage of time during which the link is functional

# Network Resilience Issues

- Whats the probability of a link failure?
- Are there alternative paths
- Is there a single point of failure
- What is the probability for 2 nodes to stay connected in a network

# Network Resilience

- A measure of network fault tolerance
- Expressed in terms of probability that the network remains connected
- Assume that the probability of link breaks are independent of each other
- Let $r_i$ denote the probability that link $i$ is not broken, and $b_i$ denote the probability that link $i$ is broken
- $r_i = 1 - b_i$

## Network Availability: Single Link

![Single link](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ammar-Hameed-Shnain/publication/326254297/figure/fig1/AS:744337528872964@1554475304940/Network-topology-for-Single-link-network.jpg)

If the probability that the link between 4 and 5 breaks is 0.05, then

- Link Availability between 4 and 5 = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95

## Network Availability: Series

![Network availability series and parallel](http://imgdetail.ebookreading.net/system_admin/3/1587052156/1587052156__building-resilient-ip__1587052156__graphics__br630201.jpg)

To remain connected for a network connected in series, all links in the series must not be broken

Given the probability for a break is 0.05, and there are 2 links, then probability of availability = (1 - 0.05)(1 - 0.05) = 0.9025

## Network Availability: Parallel

For 2 nodes connected in parallel to break, all links between the 2 nodes must break.

Given the probability for a break is 0.05, and there are 2 links in parallel between the nodes, the probability that the connection break = 0.05 \* 0.05 = 0.0025

## Summary for Rules of Network Availability

- Link in series
  - Only 1 link needs to break for the nodes to be disconnected
  - Calculate the probability that all links in series are working
- Link in parallel
  - All links need to break for the nodes to be disconnected
- Combination of series and parallel
  - Decompose into paths
  - Calculate network availability using path-based approach

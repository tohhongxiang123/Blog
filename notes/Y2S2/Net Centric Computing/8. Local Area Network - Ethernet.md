# LAN - Ethernet

# Ethernet Standard - Physical Layer

- 802.3 standard defines both physical and MAC layer details
  - MAC protocol: CSMA/CD
  - Phyiscal layer:

# Ethernet Transmission Media

- Coaxial cable
  - Thick coax: Used by original ethernet (bus topology)
  - Thin coax: More flexible, however shorter network span
- Twisted pair: For star topology, used with a hub, most commonly used
- Optical fibre: Expensive, fragile, difficult to handle, however high data rate

# Physical Layer Configurations

- Physical layer configurations are specified in 3 parts
  - Data rate (10, 100, 1000 Mbps)
  - Signalling method
    - Baseband: Digital signaling
    - Broadband: Analog signaling
  - Cabling (2, 5, T, F, S, L)
    - 2: 200m thin coax
    - 5: 500m thick coax (original ethernet cabling)
    - T: Twisted pair
    - F: Optical fibre
    - S: Short wave laser over multimode fibre
    - LL Long wave laser over single mode fibre

# Baseband Manchester Encoding

- Baseband means that no carrier is modulated: Instead bits are encoded using manchester encoding and transmitted directly by modifying voltage of a DC signal
- Manchester encoding ensures that voltage transitions occur in each bit time which helps the receiver in clock synchronisation

# Ethernet Versions

- 10BASE-5
- 10BASE-2
- 10BASE-T
  - 10: 10 Mbps
  - BASE: Signalling mode, Base or Broad
  - 5: Medium segment length (in 100m units) or type. Includes 5, 2, T, or F
- Others

# Ethernet Frame Format

![Ethernet frame format](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/IEEE-802.3-Ethernet-Frame-Format.png)

- Preamble and SFD: 7 bytes with the pattern `10101010`, followed by 1 byte with the pattern`10101011`
  - Used for synchronising receiver to sender clock (clocks are never exact)
- DA: Destination address
- SA: Source address
- L/T: Length/Type
- Pad field
  - Allows additional dummy data to be included to a frame for min. frame size requirement
- Frame Check Sequence
  - Enables error detection using CRC. Covers between source address and pad fields (start of L/T to end of pad field)

# Ethernet Frames

- Preamble is a sequence of 7 bytes. Each byte is set to `10101010`
  - Used to synchronise receiver before actual data is sent
- Addresses
  - Unique, 48-bit unicast address assigned to each adapter
  - E.g. `08:00:e4:b1:02:a2`
  - Each manufacturer gets their own address range
  - Broadcast: All 1s
  - Multicast: First bit (from right) of the first byte is 1
  - Unicast: First bit (from right) of the first byte is 0
- Type field
  - A demultiplexing key, used to determine which higher level protocol the frame should be delivered to
- Body, which can contain up to 1500 bytes of data

## Broadcast, Multicast, Unicast

- Broadcast: One to all
- Multicast: One to many
- Unicast: One to one

E.g.

- `4A:30:10:21:10:1B` is a unicast address, since `4A` is the first byte, and the rightmost bit of `4A` is 0 (`0100 1010`)
- `47:20:1B:2E:08:EE` is a multicast address, since `47` is the first byte, and the rightmost bit of `47` is 1 (`0100 0111`)
- `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` is a broadcast address, because all the digits are `F`s, which means the entire address is all 1's

# Ethernet's MAC

- Ethernet uses CSMA/CD
  - Listens to line before/during sending
- If line is idle (No carrier sensed)
  - Send packet immediately
  - Upperbound message size of 1500 bytes
  - Must wait 9.6 us between back-to-back frames
- If line is busy (Carrier sensed)
  - Wait until idle, then transmit packet immediately (1-persistent sending)
- If collision detected
  - Stop sending, and jam signal
  - Try again later

## Frame Collisions

- Collisions are caused when 2 adaptors transmit at the same time (adaptors sense collisions based on voltage differences)
  - Both found line to be idle
  - Both had been waiting for a busy line to become idle
- When a collision occurs, we must make sure both senders know about the collision

## Ethernet Minimum Frame Size

- A sender must keep its transmission until it is sure that there are no other transmissions on the medium it is not aware of before it ends its own transmission. However, how long does it keep its transmission?
- A transmission requires an end-to-end signal propagation time $\tau$ to reach all stations (the longest), then a potential collision requires $\tau$ units of time to return to the sender
- Hence, the frame transmission $\geq 2\tau$, which is a signal round trip time
- If a frame transmission time is too small $< 2\tau$, then collisions might go undetected
  - Sender already closed before signal for collision returns back to the sender

## Collision Detection

- How can A know that a collision has taken place?
  - Must have a mechanism that ensures retransmission on collision
  - A's message reaches B at time $T$
  - B's message reaches A at time $2T$
  - So, A must still be transmitting at $2T$
- IEEE 802.3 specifies max value of 2T to be 51.2us
  - Relates to maximum distance of 2500m between hosts
    - Original 10BASE5 is 10Mbps, with 500m segments (4 repeaters max)
    - Electricity in copper cable is 200000 km/s
    - (2500m)/(200000km/s) = 12.5 us for a single trip, and 25 us for a round-trip (to and from)
    - We double the minimum amount for a safety overhead, and include repeater delay, bringing us to a maximum value of 51.2us
  - At 10Mbps, it takes 0.1us to transmit 1 bit, hence 512bits (64B) takes 51.2us to send
  - Hence, ethernet frames must be at least 64 B long
    - 14B header (destination + source address + length/type only), 46B data, 4B CRC
    - Padding is used if data is less than 46B
- Send jamming signal after collision is detected, to ensure all hosts see collision

## Jam Signals

- When a collision is detected, a station is required to transmit a jam sequence (32-48 bits long) after it has detected a collision. This makes the collision more obvious
  - Even though the signal may collide in one location (especially for short packets), it may not collide at another station's location. To ensure that all stations are able to detect the collision, this jam sequence is transmitted

# Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB)

- What should stations do when a collision is detected?
  - Discard packet
  - Choose a future slot randomly to retransmit based on binary exponential backoff (BEB)
- Delay time is selected using binary exponential backoff
  - 1st time: Choose K from { 0, 1 }, then delay = K \* 51.2us
  - 2nd time: Choose K from { 0, 1, 2, 3 }, then delay = K \* 51.2us
  - nth time: Choose K from { 0, 1, 2, ..., $2^n - 1$ }, then delay = K \* 51.2us
    - Note that the make value for $K$ is 1023
  - Give up after several retries (usually 16)
    - Report transmission error to host
- If delay were not random, there si a chance that sources would retransmit in lock step
- Why not just choose from a small set for $K$?
  - This works fine for a small number of hosts
  - However, for a large number of hosts, this would cause more collisions

# MAC Algorithm from Receiver

- Senders handle all access control
- Receivers simply read frames with acceptable address
  - Address to host
  - Address to broadcast
  - Address to multicast to which host belongs
  - All frames if host is in **promiscuous** mode

# Ethernet Evolutions

## Collision Domain

- Network region in which collisions are propagated
  - Repeaters and hubs propagate collisions
  - Bridges, switches and routers do not
- Collision frequency can be kept low by breaking the network into segments bounded by
  - Bridges
  - Switches
  - Routers

## Broadcast Domain

- Network region in which broadcast frames are propagated
  - Repeaters, hubs, bridges and switches propagate broadcasts (Layer 2)
  - Routers either do or do not, depending on their configuration (Layer 3)
- Broadcasts are necessary for network function
- Some devices and protocols produce lots of broadcasts, avoid them
- Broadcast frequency can be kept manageable by limiting the LAN size
- LANs can then be cross-connected by routers to make a larger internetwork

## Bridged Ethernet

- Bridges connect 2 or more different LANs that have a similar protocol, and provide communication between the devices in them
- Joining multiple LANs with a bridge helps in multiplying the network capacity of a single LAN

## Repeater

- A repeater (or a hub) forwards teh received signals to all output ports except the incoming port
- A collision occurs when 2 computers transmit at the same time. In this case, the channel carries no useful information

## Switch

- A switch (or switching hub) forwards the received signals only to the destination
- When 2 transmissions arrive at the switch at the same time, they will be stored in different buffers, so that their frames can be forwarded later. No collision is resulted

# Experiences with Ethernet

- Ethernets work best under light loads
  - Utilisation over 30% is considered heavy
  - Network capacity is wasted by collisions
- Most networks are limited to about 200 hosts
  - Specification allows for up to 1024
- Most networks are much shorter
  - 5-10 microsecond RTT (round trip time)
- Transport level flow control helps reduce load (number of back-to-back packets)
- Ethernet is inexpensive, fast and easy to administer

# Ethernet Problems

- Ethernet peak utilisation is pretty low (like ALOHA)
- Peak throughput worsens with
  - More hosts (More collisions)
  - Longer links (Collisions take longer to observe, more wasted bandwidth)
- Efficiency can be improved by avoiding the above conditions

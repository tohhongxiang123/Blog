- MSC (Mobile Switching Center)
    - Connects cells to wide area net
    - Manages call setup
    - Handles mobility
- Cell
    - Covers a geographical region
    - Base station (BS) similar to 802.11AP
    - Mobile users attach to network through BS
    - Air-interface: Physical and link layer protocol between mobile and base station

# Cellular Network: The First Hop

- 2 techniques for sharing mobile-to-BS radio spectrum
    - Combined FDMA/TDMA: Divide spectrum into frequency channels, divide each channel into time slots
    - CDMA: Code division multiple access

# Handover and Roaming

- Handover: Transfer a call or data session from one cell to another within the same cellular network
    - Handled by MSC, no charge
- Roaming: Mobile moves from its home cellular network to a foreign network

# Cellular Standards

- 2G systems: Voice channels
    - IS-136 TDMA: Combined FDMA/TDMA (North America)
    - GSM (Global system for mobile communications): Combined FDMA/TDMA. Most widely deployed
    - IS-95 CDMA: Code division multiple access
- 2.5G systems: Voice and data channels
    - 2G extensions: For those who can't wait for 3G
    - General packet radio service (GPRS)
        - Evolved from GSM
        - Data sent on multiple channels if available
    - Enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE)
        - Evolved from GSM, using enhanced modulation
        - Data rates up to 384kbps
    - CDMA-2000 (phase 1)
        - Data rates up to 144kbps
        - Evolved from IS-95
- 3G systems: Voice + data
    - Iniversal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS)
    - CDMA in TDMA slots
    - Data service up to 14 Mbps
- 4G systems: data
    - All IP network: Voice in data packets
    - New wireless access technologies: OFDM, MIMO etc
    - Data rate up to 300 Mbps
- 5G systems: Massive data
    - Microwaves (4G) + millimeter waves (high bandwidth)

# Mobility (Roaming) Handling

What is mobility?
- Spectrum of mobility, from the network perspective
    - No mobility
        - Mobile wireless user, using same point of access
    - Medium mobility
        - Mobile user, connecting/disconnecting from network using DHCP
    - High mobility
        - Mobile user, passing through multiple points of access while maintaining ongoing connections (like cell phone)

- Home network: Permanent "home" of mobile
- Home agent: Entity that will perform mobilty functions on behalf of mobile, when mobile is remote
- Permanent address: Address in home network, can always be used to reach mobile
    - Always remains constant
- Care-of-address: Address in visited network
- Visited network: Network in which mobile currently resides in
- Foreign agent: Entity in visited network that performs mobility functions on behalf of mobile
- Correspondent: Wants to communicate with mobile

# Mobility: Approaches

- Let routing handle it: Routers advertise permanent address of mobile-nodes-in-residence via usual routing table exchange
    - Routing tables indicate where each mobile located
    - No changes to end-systems
    - However, not scalable to millions of mobiles
- Let end-systems handle it
    - Indirect routing: Communication from correspondent to mobile goes through home agent, then forwarded to remote
    - Direct routing: Correspondent gets foreign address of mobile, sends directly to mobile

# Mobility: Registration

1. Mobile contacts foreign agent on entering visited network
2. Foreign agent contacts home agent: "this mobile is resident in my network"

End result:
- Foreign agent knows about mobile
- Home agent knows location of mobile

## Mobility via Indirect Routing

1. Correspondent addresses packets using home address of mobile
2. Home agent intercepts packet from correspondent, and forwards the packet to the foreign agent
3. Foreign agent receives the packet, and forwards to mobile
4. Mobile replies directly to correspondent

In indirect routing, mobile uses 2 addresses
- Permanent address: Used by correspondent (hence mobile location is transparent to correspondent)
- Care-of-address (Foreign address): used by home agent to forward datagrams to mobile

Triangle routing: Correspondent-home network-mobile
- Inefficient when correspondent and mobile are in the same network

Moving between networks
- Suppose mobile user moves to another network
    - Register with new foreign agent
    - New foreign agent registers with home agent
    - Home agent updates care-of-address for mobile
    - Packets continue to be forwarded to mobile (but with new care-of-address)
- Mobility, changing foreign networks
    - Transparent: Ongoing connections can be maintained

## Mobility via Direct Routing

1. Correspondent requests communication with mobile 
2. Correspondent receives foreign address of mobile
3. Correspondent forwards message to foreign agent
4. Foreign agent receives packets, forwards packets to mobile
5. Mobile replies directly with correspondent

Direct routing overcomes triangle routing problem
- Non-transparent to correspondent: Correspondent must get care-of-addres from home agent
- What if mobile changes visited network?

To accomodate for mobility with direct routing
- Anchor foreign agent: Foreign agent in first visited network
- Data always routed first to anchor foreign agent
- When mobile moves, new foreign agent arranges to have data forwarded from old FA (chaining)

# Handling Mobility in Cellular Networks

- Home network: Network of cellular provider you subscribe to (e.g. singtel, m1)
    - Home location register (HLR): database in home network containing permanent cell phone number, profile information (services, preferences, billing), information about current location (could be in another network)
- Visited network: Network in which mobile currently resides in
    - Visitor location register (VLR): database with entry for each user currently in network
    - Could be home network

# GSM: Indirect Routing to Mobile

When a correspondent calls a mobile,
1. Call routed to home network
2. Home MSC consults HLR, gets roaming number of mobile in visited network
3. Home MSC sets up second leg of call to MSC in visited network
4. MSC in visited network completes call through base station to mobile

# Wireless, Mobility: Impact on Higher Layer Protocols

- Logically, impact should be minimal
    - Best effort service model remains unchanged
    - Higher layers can (and do) run over wireless, mobile
- However, performance-wise
    - Packet loss/delay due to bit-errors (discarded packets, delays for link-layer retransmissions) and handoffs
    - Delay impairments for real-time traffic
    - Limited bandwidth of wireless links

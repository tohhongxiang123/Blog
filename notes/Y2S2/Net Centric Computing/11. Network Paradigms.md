# Network Paradigms

# Data Transmission Paradigms

- Networks are used to interconnect many devices: LAN/WAN
- Now wide are networks
    - Since the invention of the telephone, circuit switching has been the dominant technology for voice communications
    - Since 1970, packet switching has evolved substantially for digital data communications. It was designed to provide a more efficient facility than circuit switching for bursty data traffic
        - 2 types of packet switching
            - Datagram (e.g. today's internet)
            - Virtual circuit (such as frame relay, ATM)

# Network Design

Approach 1: Smart intermediate nodes, and dumb end systems
- E.g. telecommunication networks
- Achieves complex traffic management, however very difficult to upgrade

Approach 2: Dumb intermediate nodes and smart end systems
- E.g. internet
- Attract innovation at applications, but difficult to manage traffic

# (Intermediate) Switching Nodes

- Nodes may connect to other nodes, or to some stations
- Networks are usually partially connected
    - However, some redundant connections are desirable for reliability
- 2 different switching technologies
    - Circuit switching
    - Packet switching

# Communication Networks Taxonomy

Communication networks
- Circuit switched (telephone calls)
- Packet switched (data communications)
    - Virtual circuit switching (Connection oriented)
    - Datagram switching (Connectionless)

# Circuit Switching

- Circuit switching
    - There is a dedicated communication path between 2 stations (end-to-end)
    - The path is a connected sequence of links between network nodes. On each physical link, a logical channel is dedicated to the connection
- Communication via circuit switching has three phases
    - Circuit establishment (link by link)
        - Routing and resource allocation (FDM or TDM)
        - Data transfer
        - Circuit disconnect
            - Deallocate the dedicated resources
- The switches must know how to find the route to the destination and how to allocate bandwidth (channel) to establish a connection

# Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)

- Subscribers: The devices that attach to the network
- Subscriber loop: The link between the subscriber and the network
- Exchanges: The swtiching centers in the network
- End office: The switching center that directly supports subscribers
- Trunks: The branches between exchanges. They carry multiple voice-frequency circuits using either FDM or synchronous TDM

# Packet Switching Principles

- Problem of circuit switching
    - Designed for voice service
    - Resources dedicated to a particular call
    - For data transmission, much of the time the connection is idle (e.g. web browsing)
    - Data rate is fixed
        - Both ends must operate at the same rate throughout the entire period of the connection
    - Packet switching is designed to address these problems

## Basic Operations

- Data is transmitted in short packets
    - Typically in the order of 1000 bytes
    - Longer messages are split into series of packets
    - Each packet contains a portion of the user data plus some control information
- Control information contains at least
    - Routing (addressing) information, so as to be routed to the intended destination
- Store and forward
    - On each switching node, packets are received, stored briefly (buffered) and passed on to the next node

## Advantages of Packet Switching

- Line efficiency
    - Single node-to-node links can be dynamically shared by many packets over time
    - Packets are queued up and transmitted as fast as possible
- Data rate conversion
    - Each station connects to the local node at its own speed
- In circuit switching, a connection could be blocked if there lacks free resources. On a packet-switching network, even with heavy traffic, packets are still accepted, yet causing an increased delay
- Priorities can be used
    - On each node, packets with higher priority can be forwarded first. They will experience less delay than lower-priority packets

## Packet Switching Technique

- A station breaks long messages into packets
- Packets are sent out to the network sequentially, one at a time
- How will the network handle this stream of packets as it attempts to route them through the dnetwork and deliver them to the intended destination?
    - 2 alternative approaches
        - Datagram approach
        - Virtual circuit approach

### Datagram

- Each packet is treated independently, with no reference to packets that have gone before
    - Each node chooses the next node on a packet's path
- Packets can take any possible route
- Packets may arrive at the receiver out of order
- Packets may go missing
- It is up to the receiver to re-order packets and recover from missing packets
- E.g. internet
- Each packet carries the full destination address
- Packets are called datagrams

### Virtual Circuit

- In virtual circuit, a pre-planned route is established before any packets are sent, then all packets follow the same route
- Each packet contains a virtual circuit identifier, instead of a destination address, and each node on the pre-established route knows where to forward such packets
    - The node need not make a routing decision for each packet
- E.g. X.25, Frame Relay, ATM

- A route between stations is set up prior to transfer
- All data packets then follow the same route
- However, there is no dedicated resources reserved for the virtual circuit! Packets need to be stored-and-forwarded

## Virtual Circuits vs Datagrams

Virtual circuits
- Network can provide sequencing (packets arrive at the same order) and error control (retransmission between 2 nodes)
- Packets are forwarded more quickly
    - Based on the virtual circuit identifier
    - No routing decisions to make
- Less reliable
    - If a node fails, all virtual circuits that pass through the node will fail

Datagram
- No call setup phase
    - Good for bursty data, such as web applications
- More flexible
    - If a node fails, packets may find an alternate route
    - Routing can be used to avoid congested parts of the network

## Delays in Packet-switched networks

- Propagation delay + Transmission delay + processing and queueing delay

There is a pipeline effect
- Packets can be queued in a pipeline
- While a packet is being queued, another packet can be sent at the same time
- Reduces waiting time

## Packet Transmission Time: Overhead vs Pipeline

- In general, transation delay = transaction delay of all packets in first hop + (number of hops - 1) * transaction delay of 1 packet
- To find optimum packet size, must consider other delays such as
    - Processing delay
    - Queueing delay
    - Signal propagation delay

# Error Control

# Error Control in Data Link Layer

-   Objective: To detect and correct errors that occur in frame transmission

Frame Error in Data Link Layer (DLL)

-   Lost Frame: The receiver does not receive a frame (or the header was corrupted such that the frame was not recognisable)
-   Damaged Frame: The receiver receives a frame, but some of its bits are in error

# Error Detection Techniques

## Parity Check

-   Parity check: A single bit is appended to the original message (usually 7 bits) to describe the message characteristics
    -   Even Parity: Total number of bits (including parity bit) is even
    -   Odd Parity: Total number of bits (including parity bit) is odd

## Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

-   Multiple parity bits are appended to the original message
-   Generating CRC bits on the sender side:
    1. Let the divisor $d$ be $L$ bits long. Append $L - 1$ zeros on the end of the message $M$. For this example, we will use $d = 1101$ and $M = 100100$. Appending 3 zeros behind $M$, $M' = 100100000$
    2. Calculate the quotient and the remainder of $M / d$
    3. The CRC code is the remainder of the division, and is $L - 1$ bits long. The remainder of the above division is $100100000 / 1101 = 001$. So the data to be transmitted is the message $M$ appended with the CRC code $r$ (100100 001)
-   Receiving the data on the receiver side:
    1. The receiver receives a message $M$, and uses the same divisor $d$
    2. We now perform division $M / d$. If the remainder is 0, then there was no error detected in transmission. Else, there is an error detected in the transmission

# Error Correction Techniques

Forward Error Correction (FEC)

-   Send more redundant bits in the message
-   Example: Hamming codes, Reed-Solomon codes

Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)

-   Contains 2 parts: Retransmission after timeout and retransmission when requested
-   Retransmission after timeout: The source retransmits a frame when an expected ACK fails to return within a predetermined time duration
-   Retransmission when requested: The destination replies with a negative ACK to inform the source about an error. The source then retransmits the corrupted frames accordingly

## ARQ Variants

-   Stop and wait ARQ
-   Sliding Window ARQs
    -   Go-back-N ARQ
        -   Frames are accepted strictly in the sequence
    -   Selective Reject ARQ
        -   Or Selective Repeat ARQ, frames which arrive out of sequence (but are within the open window at the receiver) are accepted

### Stop and Wait ARQ

#### Protocol

-   Source
    -   Transmits a single frame and waits for ACK
-   Destination
    -   Frame received correctly: Send ACK
    -   Damaged frame received. 2 possible variations
        -   Discard, and do nothing else
        -   Send a NAK (Negative acknowledgement)
-   Source
    -   If ACK received properly, transmit next frame
    -   If NAK received, retransmit same frame
    -   If no ACK received after timeout, transmitter timeouts and retransmits same frame
    -   If ACK damaged, transmitter will not recognise ACK, and transmitter will then timeout, and retransmit same frame. Receiver gets 2 copies of the same frame, but discards the extra copy

#### Performance of Stop-and-Wait ARQ

Recall that

$$
U = \frac{T_{frame}}{T_{cycle}}
$$

Let $P$ be the frame loss probability, and $a$ be the normalised propagation delay ($a = \frac{T_{prop}}{T_{frame}}$)
The throughput of SaW ARQ is

$$
U = \frac{1}{1 + 2a} P(\text{No error}) + 0 * P(\text{Frame error}) = \frac{1 - P}{1 + 2a}
$$

### Go Back N ARQ

![Go back N ARQ](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/go-back-n-arq16.png)

-   When the receiver receives a NAK for frame $i$, the sender will go back to frame $i$ and send again from there
-   If a receiver was supposed to receive frame $i$, but receives frame $i + 1$ instead, the receiver detects that frames are out of sequence. The receiver will send back a NAK for frame $i$, and the sender will go back to frame $i$ and send from there again
-   Frames received out of sequence are discarded

#### Protocol

-   Source: Transmits frames sequentially based on sliding window
-   Destination:
    -   For error-free frames, ACKs are sent as usual. ACK is usually called "Receive Ready" (RR)
    -   Can use "Receiver not Ready" (RNR) for controlling the flow
    -   If a damaged frame is received, NAK is sent. NAK is usually called "Reject" (REJ). The destination discards the damaged frame, and all subsequent frames, until damaged frame is received successfully
-   Source: If NAK is received, retransmit that frame, and all subsequent frames

#### Max Window Size

-   To keep a sequence for the frames, we append $k$ bits to the end of each frame to denote the frame number
-   Hence, with $k$ bits, the maximum window size is $2^k - 1$
-   More information [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9341905/the-realationship-between-window-size-and-sequence-number) and [here](https://upscfever.com/upsc-fever/en/gatecse/en-gatecse-chp97.html)

#### Performance

Assumptions:

1. $T_{ack}$ and $T_{proc}$ are negligible
2. Frames are never completely lost on the medium
3. ACKs and NAKs are never in error
4. Each frame is individually acknowledged immediately
5. Sender always has frames to send

$$
U = \begin{cases}
\frac{1 - P}{1 + 2aP} & N \geq 2a + 1 \\
\frac{N(1 - P)}{(1 - P + NP)(1 + 2a)} & N < 2a + 1
\end{cases}
$$

### Selective Reject ARQ

![Selective Reject ARQ](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Sliding-Window-Protocol.jpg)

-   Only rejected frames are retransmitted (including timed-out frames)
-   Receiver informs transmitter of rejected frame $n$ by sending $NAK_n$ (Selectively reject $n$)
-   After receiving an erroneous frame, subsequent frames are accepted by the receiver and buffered
-   After receiving a valid copy of the error frame, frames are put in proper order, and passed to the higher layer
-   Minimises retransmission, and thus more efficient than Go-back-N
-   However, receiver requires more complex buffer management

#### Max Window Size

With Selective Reject ARQ, max window size is $2^{k - 1}$, if $k$ bit sequencing is used. Reasoning is [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3999065/why-is-window-size-less-than-or-equal-to-half-the-sequence-number-in-sr-protocol)

#### Performance

Since frame loss probability for each transaction is independent, in a $1 + 2a$ cycle, we expect $N$ tranmissions, each with a probability of $P$ of failing

$$
U = \begin{cases}
1 - P & N \geq 2a + 1
\frac{N(1 - P)}{1 + 2a} N < 2a + 1
\end{cases}
$$

Note that if $P = 0$, we have the same throughput as sliding window

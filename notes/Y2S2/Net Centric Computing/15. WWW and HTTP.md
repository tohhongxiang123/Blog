# WWW and HTTP

# Application Layer

There are many protocols/applications in the application layer
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
    - Skype/Zoom
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
    - FTP (File transfer protocol)
    - HTTP (Hyptertext Transfer Protocol)
        - World wide web

# WWW

- World wide web (WWW) is a network application which allows a client to access hypertext file from a server - more than just text/images/audio etc
- Note:
    - The internet is a collection of computers and other devices connected by equipment that allows them to communicate with each other
    - The web is a collection of software and protocols that run as applications of internet, e.g. http, telnet, ftp
- WWW allows a client to access a file (hypertext) from a server
- HTTP is the application layer protocol used by WWW. HTTP is designed to run over TCP with server listening at port 80
- HTTP consists of request/response messages

# HTTP

- HTTP Request
    - Form: HTTP-method doct-path-url HTTP-version 
    - Header fields
    - blank line
    - Message body (optional)
    - E.g. GET /pub/WWW/project.html HTTP/1.1
- Most commonly used methods: GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE
- Most commonly used header fields: Accept: text/plain, Accept: text/*, If-Modified-Since: date, Content-Length, Content-Type: text/html
- Type specifications: type/subtype
    - text/plain, text/html, image/jpeg

```
GET /doc/test.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.test101.com
Accept: image/gif, image/jpeg, */*
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0
Content-Length: 35

```

- HTTP Response
    - Form: Status line
    - Response header fields
    - blank line
    - Response body (optional)
- Status line format:
    - HTTP-version status-code explanation
    - E.g. HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    - Status code is a 3 digit number
- Examples of status codes:
    - 200 OK
    - 301 Moved permanently
    - 304 Not modified
    - 400 Bad request

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 09 Feb xxxx 01:11:12 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.29 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Sat, 07 Feb xxxx
ETag: "0-233-4024c3a5"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 35
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

# Non-Persistent vs Persistent HTTP

![persistent vs non-persistent http](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/HTTP_persistent_connection.svg/600px-HTTP_persistent_connection.svg.png)

- Non-persistent HTTP: Individual TCP connection/termination for each pair of request/response to access 1 file: Inefficient
- Persistent HTTP: multiple request/response messages within 1 TCP connection - efficient for accessing multiple files in the same server

# Domain Name System

- Given only the domain name of a server, how does the client know the IP address to send to the destination? (e.g. www.google.com)
- DNS is used to resolve domain name to IP address
- DNS protocol is designed to run over UDP with server listening at well-known port 53
- Domain names are divided into gTLDs and ccTLDs, and commercial domain name registrars are accredited to sell them
    - generic top level domains (gTLDs): only IANA/ICANN-accredited registrars are able to sell domain names under gTLDs
    - Country-code Top-Level Domains (ccTLDs): delegated to respective countries
        - E.g. only singapore SGNIC-accredited registrars can sell domain names under .sg
- For scalability, domain names are designed to be hierarchical; e.g. ece.toronto.edu
    - ece: 3rd level, toronto: 2nd level, edu: top level
    - Top level domains are managed by IANA
    - Below top-level domains, management of name space is delegated to respective organisations
    - Each organisation can delegate further
- A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a completely specified domain name consisting of a host name and a domain
- Following the hierarchy of domain names, a hierarchy of name servers are setup to provide DNS services
    - Each server is responsible (authoritative) for a zone of the DNS namespace
    - A zone can be a node; e.g. edu server is authoritative for xxx.edu
    - A zone can also consist of multiple nodes: e.g. virginia.edu server is authoritative for xxx.virginia.edu, including xxx.cs.virginia.edu
- To be fault-tolerant, there are 13 root name servers which are configured to know the authoritative servers for TLDs
    - In reality, there are more than 13 physical root name servers through the use of anycast
    - Anycast is a group of servers which are identified by the same IP address, and packets are routed to the nearest servers

# Reaching an Internet Resource

We need to specify
1. Method/Protocol used (application layer)
2. Host using IP address or domain name (network layer)
3. Port number (or none if using default well-known port) (transport layer)
4. Path and document name (application layer)

In practice, all the above are concatenated into a single string called the uniform resource locator (URL)

```
Method://Host:Port/Path
https://www.example.com/test/index.html
```

# Web Proxy (Cache)

- Improve performance by caching
- Reduce traffic load on costly access links
- Monitor/filter contents
- How do web proxies work?
    1. Client requests to proxy
    2. If content is not available from the proxy, proxy requests to origin server
    3. Origin server responds to proxy
    4. Proxy responds to client
- Traditionally, web proxies are implemented by requiring users to explicitly configure their browsers
- However, note that web proxies can be implemented transparently without the knowledge of users/servers
    - Basically, the organisation/ISP configures its routers to intercept all web traffic, and redirect/misdirect them to its web proxy, which masquerades as the destination server
- Alternatively , if performance is important, an option for content provider is to use the service of Content Delivery/Distribution Network (CDN)
    - E.g. Akamai CDN, Cloudflare

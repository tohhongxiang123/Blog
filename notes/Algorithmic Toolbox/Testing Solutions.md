# Testing Solutions

1. Create a slow, naive but definitely correct algorithm to test your optimised algorithm
2. Generate random inputs to test
3. Make sure both the slow and fast solution output the correct results

Start off with small combinations of arguments before testing bigger test cases. This makes debugging easier in case your solution is incorrect

# 443. String Compression

- https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/

Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in `chars`:

- If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
- Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the input character array `chars`. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.

You must write an algorithm that uses only **constant extra space**.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        group_frequency = 1
        current_letter = chars[0]
        result = []
        
        current_index = 0
        length = len(chars)
        
        while current_index < length - 1:
            if chars[current_index] == chars[current_index + 1]: # while we are in the same group
                group_frequency += 1 # update our group frequency
                del chars[current_index] # delete the character in the same group
                length -= 1 # update the length
                continue
                
            if group_frequency > 1: # insert frequency into array only if more than 1
                to_insert = str(group_frequency)
                for c in to_insert:
                    chars.insert(current_index + 1, c)
                    current_index += 1
                    length += 1

            current_index += 1 # update the current index to point to the next group
            group_frequency = 1 # reset our group frequency
                
        if group_frequency > 1: # handle the last group
            to_insert = str(group_frequency)
            for c in to_insert:
                chars.insert(current_index + 1, c)
                current_index += 1

            
        return len(chars)

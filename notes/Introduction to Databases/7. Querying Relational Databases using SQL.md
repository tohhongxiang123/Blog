# Querying Relational Databases using SQL

# What is SQL

- Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard query language for relational databases

# What can we do with SQL?

- Manage and query the database (a set of relations/tables)
- Retrieve
- Insert
- Delete
- Update

SQL is declarative
- A SQL query specifies what to retrieve, but not how to retrieve it (procedural)

# Functions Supported by SQL

Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- Perform queries
- Perform updates (add/delete/modify)

Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Creates databases, tables, indices
- Creates views
- Specify authorisation
- Specify integrity constraints

Embedded SQL
- Wrap a high-level programming language around DML to do more sophisticated queryies/updates

# Tables in SQL

A relation or table is a multiset of tuples having the attributes specified by the schema. 
- A multiset is an unordered list (or: a set with multiple duplicate instances allowed)

For example: 

| PName       | Price | Manufacturer |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------ |
| Gizmo       | 20    | GizmoWorks   |
| Powergizmo  | 30    | GizmoWorks   |
| SingleTouch | 150   | Canon        |
| MultiTouch  | 204   | Hitachi      |

## Attributes (Columns) in a Table

An attribute (or column) is a typed data entry present in each tuple in the relation
- Attributes must have an atomic type in sstandard SQL, i.e. not a list, set, etc.

## Tuples (Rows) in a Table

A tuple or row is a single entry in the table having the attributes specified by the schema
- Also referred to sometimes as a record

## More on Tables

- The number of tuples is the cardinality of the relation
- The number of attributes is the arity of the relation

# Data Types in SQL

Atomic types
- Characters: `CHAR(20)`, `VARCHAR(50)`
- Numbers: `INT`, `BIGINT`, `SMALLINT`, `FLOAT`
- Others: `MONEY`, `DATETIME`

Every attribute must have an atomic type
- Hence the tables are flat

# Schema of a Table

| PName       | Price | Manufacturer |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------ |
| Gizmo       | 20    | GizmoWorks   |
| Powergizmo  | 30    | GizmoWorks   |
| SingleTouch | 150   | Canon        |
| MultiTouch  | 204   | Hitachi      |

- The schema of table is the table name, its attributes, and their types:

```
Product(Pname: string, Price: float, Manufacturer: string)
```

- A key is an attribute whose values are unique; we underline a primary key

# Principle Form of SQL

Basic Structure of SQL

```
SELECT desired attributes (A1, A2, ..., An)
FROM one or more tables (R1, R2, ..., Rm)
WHERE condition about tuples of the tables (P)
```

Mapping to Relational Algebra

$$
\Pi_{A_1, A_2, ..., A_n} (\sigma_P (R_1 \times R_2 \times \cdot \times R_m))
$$

# SQL Syntax

## Reserved words/Keywords

- There is a set of reserved words that cannot be used as names for database objects
- `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc.

## Case-insensitive

- SQL is generally case-insensitive
    - Exception: String constants are case sensitive ('FRED' vs 'fred')
- Use single quotes for constants
    - 'abc' is valid
    - "abc" is invalid
- White-space is ignored
- All statements end with a semicolon;

# Simple SQL Query: Selection

Selection is the operation of filtering a relation's tuples on some condition

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Product
WHERE Category = 'Gadgets';
```

This query selects all columns from the `Product` relation, where `Category = 'Gadgets'`

# Simple SQL Query: Projection

Projection is the operation of producing an output table with typles that have a subset of their prior attributes

```sql
SELECT PName, Price, Manufacturer
FROM Product
WHERE Category = 'Gadgets';
```

This query selects the specific columns: `PName`, `Price`, `Manufacturer` from the relation `Product`, where `Category = 'Gadgets'`

# `DISTINCT`: Eliminating Duplicates

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Category 
FROM Product;
```

# `AS`: Renaming Attributes

```sql
SELECT PName AS Product, Price AS Cost, Manufacturer
FROM Product
WHERE Category = 'Gadgets'
```

# Expressions in `SELECT` Clause

```sql
SELECT PName, Price * 1.4 AS Cost_IN_SGD, Manufacturer
FROM Product
WHERE Category = 'Gadgets'
```

# Complex Conditions in `WHERE` Clause

## `AND`

Both sides of the `AND` condition must be true for the row to be selected

```sql
SELECT Pname, Price, Manufacturer
FROM Product
WHERE Category = 'Gadgets' AND Price < 20
```

## `BETWEEN`

Check if value of attribute must be between 2 values

```sql
SELECT PName, Price, Manufacturer
FROM Product
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20
```

## `IN`

Check whether value is included in a collection

```sql
SELECT PName, Price, Manufacturer
FROM Product
WHERE Manufacturer IN ('GizmoWorks', 'Samsung', 'Hitachi')
```

## `LIKE` (String Pattern Matching)

`s LIKE p`: Pattern matching on strings. Patterns are case sensitive
- `p` may contain 2 special symbols
    - `%`: any sequence of characters
    - `_`: any single character

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE PName LIKE '%gizmo%';
```

This query selects all products where the `PName` contains the word `'gizmo'`

- `'John%'` - Matches any string beginning with "John"
- `'%ohn%' - Matches any string containing "ohn" as substring
- `'___'` - Matches any string with exactly 3 characters
- `'___%'` - Matches any string of at least 3 characters
- `'ab\%cd%'` - Matches all strings beginning with "ab%cd"

# `NULL` Values

Tuples in SQL relations can have `NULL` as value for one or more attributes. It means that a value is missing, or inapplicable

```sql
SELECT PName, Price, Manufacturer
FROM Product
WHERE Price <= 150 OR PRICE >= 150;
```

# SQL: 3-Valued Logic

For boolean expressions, the logic of conditions are either
- `TRUE`
- `FALSE`
- `UNKNOWN`

Comparing with NULL
- When any value is compared with `NULL`, the truth value is `UNKNOWN`

SQL Rules
- A query only produces a typle in the answer if its truth value for the `WHERE` clause is `TRUE` (not `FALSE` or `UNKNOWN`)

# `ORDER BY`: Sorting Results

```sql
SELECT PName, Price, Manufacturer
FROM Product
WHERE Category = 'Gadgets' AND Price < 50
ORDER BY Price, PName;
```

- Ordering is ascending unless you specify `DESC` keyword
    - `ORDER BY Price, PName DESC`
- Ties are broken by the second attribute on the `ORDER BY` list, etc.

## `NULL`s in `ORDER BY`

- `NULL` is normally treated as less than all non-null values

# Multi-Relation Queries

Sailors

| sid | sname | rating | age |
| --- | ----- | ------ | --- |
| 1   | Fred  | 7      | 22  |
| 2   | Jim   | 2      | 39  |
| 3   | Nancy | 8      | 27  |

Reserves

| sid | bid | bady |
| --- | --- | ---- |
| 1   | 102 | 9/12 |
| 2   | 102 | 9/13 |

```sql
SELECT S.sname
FROM Sailors S, Reserves R
WHERE S.sid = R.sid AND R.bid = 102;
```

# Subqueries

- Also called nested queries
- We can do nested queries because SQL is compositional
    - Everything (inputs/outputs) is represented as multisets - the output of one query can thus be used as the input to another (nesting)

## Types of Subqueries

- Scalar Subquery
    - Returns a single value which is then used in a comparison
    - If query expects a single value from a subquery and it returns multiple values or no values, a run-time error occurs
- Row Subquery
    - Returns a single row which may have multiple columns
- Table Subquery
    - Returns one or more columns and multiple rows 

### Scalar Subquery

E.g.: From `Sells(bar, beer, price)`, find the bars that serve Heineken for the same price `WOOBAR` charges for `Bud`

1. First, we find the price `WOOBAR` charges for `Bud`

```sql
SELECT price 
FROM Sells 
WHERE bar = 'WOOBAR' AND beer = 'Bud';
```

2. Find bars that serve Heineken for the same price

```sql
SELECT bar
FROM Sells
WHERE Sells.beer = 'Heineken' AND 
    Sells.price = (SELECT price 
                    FROM Sells 
                    WHERE bar = 'WOOBAR' AND beer = 'Bud');
```

### Row Subquery

Returns a single row which may have multiple columns
- Note that a single column with multiple rows is valid, as well as a single row with multiple columns

```sql
SELECT agent_name, agent_code, phone_no
FROM agents
WHERE agent_code = (
    SELECT agent_code 
    FROM agents
    WHERE agent_name = 'Alex'
);
```

#### Operators in Row Subquery

- `IN`
    - `<tuple> IN <relation>` is true if and only if the typle is a member of the relation

For example, if we had `Beers(name, manf)` and `Likes(drinker, beer)`, find the name and manufacturer of each beer that fred likes

```sql
SELECT name, manf
FROM beers
WHERE name IN(
    SELECT beer
    FROM Likes
    WHERE drinker = 'Fred'
)
```

- `ALL`
    - `x <> ALL(<relation>)` is true if and only if for every tuple `t` in the relation, `x` is not equal to `t`

From `Sells(bar, beer, price)`, find the beer(s) that sold for the highest price

```sql
SELECT beer
FROM Sells
WHERE price >= ALL (
    SELECT price
    FROM sells
)
```

- `ANY/SOME`
    - `x = SOME(<relation>)` is a boolean condition. Meaning that `x` **equals at least 1** tuple in the relation
    - Early version of SQL allowed `ANY`

From `Agents(agent_code, agent_name)`, `Customer(agent_code, cust_country)`, report all agents who belong to the country 'UK'

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Agents
WHERE agent_code = SOME(
    SELECT agent_code
    FROM Customer
    WHERE cust_country = 'UK'
)
```

### More Operators for Subquery

- Any of the comparison operators `<, <=, =`, etc.
- The keyword `NOT` can proceed any of the operators (`s NOT IN R`)

### Table Subquery

- Returns one or more columns and multiple rows

```sql
SELECT p1.name
FROM Product p1
WHERE p1.maker = 'Gizmo-Works'
AND EXISTS(
    SELECT *
    FROM Product p2
    WHERE p2.maker <> 'Gizmo-Works'
    AND p1.name = p2.name
);
```

This query select all products made by "Gizmo-Works" having the same names as products made by other companies

### Uncorrelated Subqueries

- A subquery is uncorrelated if the subquery is not related to the outer query

### Correlated Subqueries

- A subquery is correlated with the outer query if it contains a reference to an attribute in the outer query
- A subquery is correlated with the outside query if it must be re-computed for every typle produced by the outside query

```sql
SELECT p1.name
FROM Product p1
WHERE p1.maker = 'Gizmo-Works'
AND EXISTS(
    SELECT *
    FROM Product p2
    WHERE p2.maker <> 'Gizmo-Works'
    AND p1.name = p2.name
);
```

## Subquery: Rules to Remember

- The `ORDER BY` clause may not be used in a subquery
- The number of attributes in the `SELECT` clause in the subquery must match the number of attributes wiht the comparison operator
- Column names in a subquery refer to the table name in the `FROM` clause of the subquery by default
- When the result of a subquery is used as an opearnd, it must be the right operand

# Joins

A `JOIN` is used to combine rows from 2 tables or more, based on a related column between them. Consider the following table

Orders

| OrderID | CustomerID | OrderDate  |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 10308   | 2          | 1996-09-18 |
| 10309   | 1          | 1996-09-19 |

Customers

| CustomerID | CustomerName                       | ContactName    | Country |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| 1          | Alfreds Futterkiste                | Maria Anders   | Germany |
| 2          | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo   | Mexico  |
| 3          | Antonio Moreno Taquería            | Antonio Moreno | Mexico  |

## Inner Join

![](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_innerjoin.gif)

The $\bowtie$ operator. Returns records that have matching values in both tables. The syntax is as follows

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```

| OrderID | CustomerName                       | OrderDate  |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 10308   | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | 1996-09-18 |
| 10309   | Alfreds Futterkiste                | 1996-09-19 |

## Left (Outer) Join

![](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_leftjoin.gif)

The $\mathring{\bowtie}_L$ operator. Returns all records on the left table, and matched records from the right table. Unmatched records on the right table will be `NULL`. The syntax is as follows

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

```sql
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
```

| CustomerName                       | OrderID | OrderDate  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Alfreds Futterkiste                | 10309   | 1996-09-18 |
| Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | 10308   | 1996-09-18 |
| Antonio Moreno Taquería            | null    | null       |

## Right (Outer) Join

![](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_rightjoin.gif)

`RIGHT JOIN` returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matching records from the left table (table1). Similar to the $\mathring{\bowtie}_R$ operator.

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

## Full Outer Join

![](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_fulljoin.gif)

Similar to the $\mathring{\bowtie}$ operator. The `FULL OUTER JOIN` keyword returns all matching records from both tables whether the other table matches or not. So, if there are rows in `table1` that do not have matches in `table2`, or if there are rows in `table2` that do not have matches in `table1`, those rows will be listed as well.

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;
```

# `EXCEPT`

Similar to the $-$ operator. Returns records returned by `query1` that are not in `query2`

```sql
SELECT query1
EXCEPT
SELECT query2
```

# `UNION`

The `UNION` operator is used to combine the result-set of 2 or more `SELECT` statements
- Every `SELECT` within `UNION` must have the same number of columns
- Columns must also have similar data types
- Columns in every `SELECT` statement must be in the same order

```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```

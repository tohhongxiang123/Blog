# Conditional Execution

```
statement1
statement2
statement3
...
statementN
```

In java, statements are executed in order, from the top to the bottom (as long as no exceptions occur)

# Control Structures

-   A language feature (syntax) that affects the flow of control in a program.
-   By default, control flow is sequential
-   Control flows jumps to methods, then returns
-   Various keywords introduce changes to the default flow
    -   if
    -   while
    -   break
    -   return
    -   switch
    -   for
    -   continue

Program reaches a decision point. It decides which statements are going to be executed next.

```java
int x = 5;

if (x > 5) {
    System.out.println("X is greater than 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("X is less than 5")
}
```

# Relational Operators

-   `==` (equals)
-   `!=` (not equals)
-   `>=` (greater than or equal to)
-   `<=` (less than or equal to)
-   `>` (greater than)
-   `<` (less than)

# Boolean Operators

-   `&&` (AND)
-   `||` (OR)

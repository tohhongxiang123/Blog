# Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm used by nearly every developer at some point in their career. OOP is the most popular programming paradigm and is taught as the standard way to code for most of a programmers educational career.

Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages including JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python.

# Class

A class is a template for creating objects. For example, let us create a robot.

This robot has a `name`, a `color`, and a `max_speed`. These are all **variables** of a class, because each robot can have different names, colors, or max speeds.

This robot also has different operations it can perform, such as `Robot.speak()` or `Robot.walk()`. These are called methods, operations the class can perform.

After writing the `Robot` class, we can use that class to create **specific instances** of a class. For example, a specific instance of a `Robot` could have a name "HAL" and have the color red, while another instance could have a name "WALL-E" and have a silver color.

All these robots stem from the same `Robot` class, and can be reused for a variety of differnt things. This is so that you don't have to write the same code twice

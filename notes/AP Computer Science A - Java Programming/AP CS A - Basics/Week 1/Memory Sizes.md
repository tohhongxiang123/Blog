# Memory Sizes

Memory is usually measured in **bytes**, which are multiples of 8 bits.

A computer represents information in 2 states

- 0 (off)
- 1 (on)

Each digit is a single **bit**, and 8 bits make a **byte**

1 byte: 0000 0000

In 8 bytes, there are a total of $2^8 = 256$ possible values

There are also prefixes to represent larger amount of bytes. Here is a table

| Abbreviation  | Amount of bytes            | Practical Measure                |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| byte (B)      | $2^0 = 1$                  | A single character               |
| kilobyte (KB) | $2^10 = 1024$              | A paragraph of text              |
| megabyte (MB) | $2^20 = 1 048 576$         | A minute of MP3 music            |
| gigabyte (GB) | $2^30 = 1 073 741 824$     | A half hour of DVD video         |
| terabyte (TB) | $2^40 = 1 099 511 627 776$ | 80% of a human's memory capacity |

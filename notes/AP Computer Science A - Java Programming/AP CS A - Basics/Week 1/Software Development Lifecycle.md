# Software Development Lifecycle

When developing software, we need to have in mind the basic steps in the software development life cycle.

1. Understand the problem
2. Design the solution
3. Implement the solution
4. Testing the solution
5. Maintaining the code

## Understanding the problem

In classes and school, problems are usually well described, and all the requirements are listed out. However, in the real world, the requirements may not be as clear, and you will need to have discussions with the clients you are building the software for, in order to specify exactly what is needed

## Design the solution

In OOP, we would need to figure out what classes we need, the characteristics of those objects, and how they interact with one another

## Implement the solution

We convert the ideas we had in the first 2 steps into actual code

## Testing the solution

Testing the code ensures that no errors are encountered, and all possible cases are taken care of in trying to solve the problem. A good strategy to test code is
1. Write a small piece of code
2. Test that small piece
3. Return to step 1

By testing code 1 small piece at a time, we are more easily able to identify bugs and problems before they become hard to trace. It is a lot easier to find a bug in 10 lines of code, rather than a bug in the middle of 50 different files, each with thousands of lines of code

## Maintaining the code

Software always changes throughout its lifetime. Software needs to updated or patched due to requirements change. If the first few steps were done well, maintaining code is very easy to do.

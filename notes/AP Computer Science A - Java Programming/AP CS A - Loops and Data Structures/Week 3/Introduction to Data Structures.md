# Introduction to Data Structures

- Single variables holding single values is not enough
- Need
  - ways to treat data in bulk
  - treat a collection as a single unit
- "data structures" are used
- Arrays are an example

# Data Structure Characteristics
- Contents: types of values
  - heterogeneous data values (Values all have different types)
  - homogeneous data values (All values have the same type)
- Size: number of data values contained
  - static (fixed)
  - dynamic (can grow or shrink)
- Element access: How efficiently can different elements be inserted, deleted, updated?
  - Sequential access
  - Random access

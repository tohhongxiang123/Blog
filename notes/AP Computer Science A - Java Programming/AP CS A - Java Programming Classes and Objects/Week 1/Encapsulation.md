# Encapsulation

-   Controlling data in class
-   Access modifiers
-   Black box methods
-   Accessors and mutators

Encapsulation is usually implemented through **access modifiers**

# Access Modifiers

-   `public`
-   `private`
-   `protected`

We always provide as limited amount of functionality as possible to the client to allow them to use the object, so as to protect information integrity within the class.

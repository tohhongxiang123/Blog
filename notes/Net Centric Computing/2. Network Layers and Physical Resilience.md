# Network Layers and Physical Resilience

- Networks are complex with many pieces
    - Hosts, routers, links, hardware, software, protocols etc
- Dealing with complex systems
    - Explicit structures allow identification, relationship of different pieces
    - Modularisation easing maintenance and updating
        - Change of a layer's service transparent to the rest of the system
        - Change in network technology does not affect the rest of the system
    - Layering harmful? (Design vs Implementation)

For example,
- Browser requests web page from the server
- Server determines if access is granted
- Reliable transfer page from server to client
- Physical transfer of bits from server to client

# Layered Network Architecture

- Network organised as a stack of layers
    - Purpose of layers is to offer services to the layer above it and passes data and control information to the layer below, using a well-defined interface
    - Redcuces design complexity
- Protocols: A set of rules governing communication between two peering parties or computers
    - Define format, order of messages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on message transmission and receipt
- Network architecture: A set of layers and protocols with specifications enabling hardware/software developers to build systems compliant with a particular architecture

## Benefits of Layers

- Simplicity
    - Easy to design once layers and their interactions are defined clearly
- Flexibility
    - Easy to modify and develop networks by separate layer modifications
- Incremental Changes
    - Easy to add new layers, or new functions to layers

## OSI-7-Layer Model

![Layers in OSI-7-Layer Model](https://www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2020/02/OSI-7-layers.jpg)

- Data
    - Application: Network process to application
    - Presentation: Data representation, encryption and decription, convert machine dependent data to machine independent data
    - Session: Inter-host communication, managing sesions between applications
- Segment
    - Transport: End-to-end connections, reliability and flow control
- Packet
    - Network: Path determination and logical addressing
- Frame
    - Data link: Physical addressing
- Bit
    - Physical: Media signal and binary transmission

### Benefits of OSI-7-Layer Model

- Functional Decomposition
    - Weakly-decoupled stack
- Encapsulation
    - Each layer adding new headers
- Peering
    - Only peer layer (the layer on top and on the bottom) communicating with each other

### OSI in Action: Encapsulation

- A message begins at the top application layer and moves down the OSI layers to the bottom physical layer
- As the message descends, each successive OSI model layers adds a header to it
- A header is layer-specific information that basically explains what functions the layer carries out
- Conversely at the receiving end, headers are stripped from the message as it travels up the OSI layers

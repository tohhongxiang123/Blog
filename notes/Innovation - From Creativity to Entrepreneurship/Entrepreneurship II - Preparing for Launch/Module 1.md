    -   (price - cost per transaction) \* (average transactions during customer lifetime)
    -   (Subscription price - monthly customer support cost) \* (average number of months before churn)
-   CLTV > CAC, then business model is viable
-   If CLTV >>>> CAC, the business model is scalable

# Pricing Strategies

-   Price > Cost
-   Price < customers' willingness to pay

Cost-based Pricing

-   Costs are sometimes unclear and frequently underestimated
    -   Marketing and seeling expenses
    -   Customer support
    -   Technology infrastructure
    -   Administrative costs
    -   Fixed and variable costs can change over time

Competitive Pricing

-   Price is based on what competitors are charing for similar or comparable products or services
-   Lower price to capture adoption and market share
-   Higher price to signal better quality

Value Pricing

-   Estimate total amount of value that your solution is creating for your customer
-   How are you creating value for your customers?
    -   Helping them make more money
    -   Helping them save money
    -   Helping them save time
    -   Helping them reduce their risk
    -   Providing a non-monetary benefit

Implementing Value Pricing

-   Use customer discovery process to understand value and willingness to pay
    -   Ask them about the options they have and the budget that has been allocated
    -   Discuss value of a solution to their problem - tangible and intangible

Variable Pricing

-   Takes advantage of the fact that some customers are willing to pay more than others
-   Good, better, best

Pricing

-   When in doubt, raise prices

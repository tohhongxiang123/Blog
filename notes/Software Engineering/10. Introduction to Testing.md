# Introduction to Testing

Testing is required to avoid bugs and flaws in the program
- A bug is an error/flaw/failure in the program that causes the program to behave unexpectedly

# Can We Test Everything?

Consider that we wanted to test the following function

```
int doSomething(int input) {
    return (input - 1) / 30000;
}
```

The function should do the following:
- Take an integer input value, add 1 to it, divide by 30000, and return the value

For a 16 bit integer, there are $2^{16}$ possible values. We can still test every possible value, however that is too costly.

We should strategically choose specific values that are likely to cause errors if the function is not correct, or inputs that cover a wide range of vales

- -1
- 0
- 32767
- -32767

# Black Box vs White Box Testing

Black box testing is a software testing method in which we do not know the implementation of the function, we only know how the function should behave
- Choose test cases that are likely to cause errors, or a range of test cases that cover a wide variety of input values

White box testing is a software testing method in which the internal structure of the function under test is known to the tester
- Usually tries to cover all statements, branches and execution paths

# Basis Path Testing

Basis Path Testing (or Structured testing) is a white box testing method used for designing test cases intended to examine all possible paths of execution in a program
- Analyse control flow graph
- Determines cyclomatic complexity of function under test (Refers to the number of linearly independent paths in the function. It is a measure of how complex a function is in regards to the number of possible paths)
- Obtains linearly independent paths
- Generates test cases for each path

# Objectives of Testing

- To show when **software does not work**
- To reduce the perceived risk of a system not working to an acceptable value
- To result in low-risk software without much testing efforts

# Types of Testing

1. Black box testing
    - Analyse the requirements and specifications of the function under test
    - E.g. "The income of an applicant should be between 1000 - 2000"
    - Types of black box testing include
        - Equivalence testing and boundary value testing
2. White box testing
    - Analyse implementation, internal paths and structure
    - Types of white box testing include
        - Control flow testing
        - Data flow testing

# Levels of Testing

1. Unit testing - Testing units individually
2. Integration testing - Test units in combination
3. System testing - Test everything (functionality, portability, usability, performance etc.)
4. Acceptance testing - Customer accepts the software and gives us money

# Components of a Test Case

1. Name: The distinct name of the test case
2. Location: Path to test program and its input
3. Input: Input data or commands
4. Oracle: Expected test output
5. Log: Actual output produced by the test

E.g. the test case for a mortgage calculator

| Income | Number of mortgages | Applicant Type | Property Type | Expected result | Test result |
| ------ | ------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 5000   | 2                   | Person         | Cando         | Approval        | Approval    |
| 100    | 1                   | Person         | HDB           | Reject          | Reject      |
| 1501   | 8                   | Person         | Condo         | Reject          | Approval    |

# Order of Test Case Execution

Cascading test cases

1. Create order
2. Update order
3. Delete order
4. Read deleted order

- Smaller and simple test cases
- However if one fails, the other test cases may be invalid

Independent test cases
- Self contained test cases for the above features
- Parallel test execution
- However, larger and more complex test cases

# Black Box Testing Process

The tester
1. Analyses requirements or specifications (The hardest step)
    - Equivalence classes and boundary values
2. Chooses valid inputs and invalid inputs (The other hardest step)
3. Determines expected outputs (oracle) for chosen inputs
4. Construct tests with the chosen inputs (e.g. writing JUnit program)

The testing engine (e.g. JUnit)
1. Executes the test
2. Compares actual outputs (log) with the expected outputs (oracle)
3. Determines whether the system under test functions properly

## Pros and Cons

Applicability
- All levels of system development (Unit, Integration, System and Acceptance testing)

Cons
- Cannot know how much of the implementation has been tested
- No notion of testing coverage like in white-box testing

Pros
- Directs the tester to a small, specific subset of test inputs that can highly likely find the bugs

## Assumptions required for Black-box Testing

1. Verifiable requirements and API specifications exist
    - Make software testable from inception
    - Unambiguous requirements ("Company can hire only people from 18-55 years old", rather than "Company must not hire too young or too old people")
2. Code must be testable
    - Code with a lot of hidden exceptions is very difficult to test under black-box testing
    - E.g. Company can hire only people from 18-55 years old, however if name == "asdf", hire him as CEO

## Motivating Example: Hire or Not?

- Test a module implementing the following hiring requirements
    - 0-15, 55-99: Do not hire
    - 16-17: Part time
    - 18-54: Full time

We shall look at the 2 types of black box testing
1. Equivalence class testing
2. Boundary value testing

### Equivalence Class Testing - Partitioning Input Values into Equivalence Classes

A set of input values forms an equivalence class if
- They all are supposed to produce the same output
- If one value catches a bug, the others probably will too
- If one value does not catch a bug, the others probably will not either

We want to identify equivalence classes for valid and invalid inputs, to minimise the number of possible inputs we are required to test

#### Equivalence Class Testing Process

The tester
1. Identify valid and invalid equivalence classes that partition the input values
2. Choose at least 1 input value for each equivalence class of each input parameter
3. Determine expected outputs for chosen inputs
4. Construct tests with the chosen inputs

The testing engine
1. Executes the test
2. Compares actual output (logs) with the expected output (oracle)
3. Determines whether the system under test functions correctly

#### Range of Values

- One equivalence class of valid values (a1 < x < a2)
- Two equivalence classes of invalid values (x <= a1, x >= a2)

For example, if a system approves an application if the mortgage per applicant is between 0 and 5
- Valid values: 0 <= x <= 5
- Invalid values, x < 0, x < 5

If the length of a password must be between 4-8 characters long,
- Valid values: 4 <= length <= 8
- Invalid values length <= 3 or length >= 9

For our example,
- Valid equivalence classes
    - 0 <= age <= 15 (Do not hire)
    - 16 <= age <= 17 (Part time)
    - 18 <= age <= 54 (Full time)
    - 55 <= age <= 99 (Do not hire)
- Invalid equivalence classes
    - age <= -1
    - age >= 100

#### Discrete Values

- One equivalence class of valid values
- One equivalence class of invalid values

For example, if a system approves only personal mortgage applications
- Valid: Person
- Invalid: Trust, Company, Partnership etc.

The system only approves HDB and Condo mortgage applications
- Valid: HDB, Condo
- Invalid: Townhouse, Mobilehome etc.

#### Design Test Cases Using Equivalence Classes

1. Test valid inputs of several parameters
    - Test valid inptus of several parameters at the same time (i.e. per test case)
    - Choose one valid input for each input parameter from an equivalence class
2. Test invalid inputs of several parameters
    - Test only one invalid input from an equivalence class of one input parameter at the same time (i.e. per test case)
    - Chosose valid inputs from an equivalence clasds of all other input parameters

For testing valid inputs:

| Income | Number of mortgage | Applicant Type | Property Type | Expected Result |
| ------ | ------------------ | -------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| $1500  | 0                  | Person         | Condo         | Approval        |
| $2000  | 1                  | Person         | Condo         | Approval        |
| $5000  | 2                  | Person         | Condo         | Approval        |
| $12345 | 3                  | Person         | HDB           | Approval        |
| $76543 | 4                  | Person         | HDB           | Approval        |
| $80000 | 5                  | Person         | HDB           | Approval        |


#### Should We Test Invalid Inputs?

- Testing by contract
    - Create test cases only for valid inputs (i.e. input values that satisfy pre-conditions)
- Defensive testing
    - Create test cases for both valid and invalid inputs
        - Do not assume that users will use your code the way it is supposed to be used
        - Test the module to check whether it behaves as expected for invalid inputs (i.e. does not cause unforeseen errors or abnormal system behavior)

Testers prefer defensive testing as it is more comprehensive. In the end, testers get blamed if the tests do not work

For testing invalid inputs using equivalence classes
- Each test case should have no more than 1 invalid input
- This is to check each individual error handling or behavior for each type of invalid input

#### Quick Summary for Equivalence Testing

A key aspect of black box testing is identifying equivalent classes. By identifying equivalence classes, it helps us test effectively with a minimal set of inputs

### Boundary Value Testing (BVT)

- Boundary Value Testing is only applicable when testing **ranges of values** (cannot be used on discrete values)
    - Focus on boundaries of the equivalence classes of range of values
    - Select a minimal set of valid and invalid inputs (values on the boundary, just below the boundary, and just above the boundary) to test
    - Discrete values do not have boundary values, hence cannot be used for boundary value testing

#### BVT Process

The tester
1. Identify the lower and upper boundaries of equivalence classes of the range of values parameters
2. Choose 3 input values for each boundary
    - One value on the boundary
    - One value just below the boundary
    - One value just above the boundary
    - The just-below and just-above values depends on the value's unit
    - No need to duplicate test cases if the just-below or just-above values fall into other equivalence classes (including the current equivalence class)
3. Determine expected outputs (oracle) for chosen inputs
4. Construct tests with the chosen inputs

Example for determining boundary values:
- Income range valid equivalence class (1500 <= x <= 80000)
    - Lower boundary 1500: 1499, 1500, (1501 not required, since it is in the same EC as 1500)
    - Upper boundary 80000: (79999 not required, since it is in the same EC as 80000), 80000, 80001
    - Valid boundary values: { 1500, 80000 }
    - Invalid boundary values: { 1499, 80001 }
- Number of mortgage valid equivalence class (0 <= x <= 5)
    - Lower boundary 0: -1, 0, (1 not required, same EC as 0)
    - Upper boundary 5: (4 not required, same EC as 5), 5, 6
    - Valid boundary values: { 0, 5 }
    - Invalid boundary values: { -1, 6 }

For our hiring rules example,
- Hiring rules (0 <= age <= 15) (Do not hire)
    - Lower boundary 0: -1, 0, (1 not required)
    - Upper boundary 15: (14 not required), 15, 16
- Hiring rules (16 <= age <= 17) (Part time)
    - Lower boundary 16: (15 not required, was in the previous EC), 16, (17 not required, in the next EC)
    - Upper boundary 17: (16 not required, in previous EC), 17, (18 not required, in the next EC)
- Hiring rules (18 <= age <= 54) (Full time)
    - Lower boundary 18: (17 previous EC), 18, (19 same EC as 18)
    - Upper boundary 54: (53 same EC as 54), 54, (55 next EC)
- Hiring rules (55 <= age <= 99) (Do not hire)
    - Lower boundary 55: (54 previous EC), 55, (56 same EC as 54)
    - Upper boundary 99: (98 same EC as 99), 99, 100

#### Design Test Cases Using BVs

1. Test valid inputs of several parameters
    - Test valid inputs of several parameters at the same time
    - Choose one valid input from an equivalence class of each input parameter
2. Test invalid inputs of several parameters
    - Test only one invalid input from an equivalence class of one input parameter per test case
    - Choose valid inputs from an equivalence class of all other input parameters

Use the boundary values of the equivalence classes of the range-of-values parameters
- Values **on-the-boundary** as **valid** inputs
- **Just below** or **just above** values (if not in other ECs including the current EC) as **invalid** inputs

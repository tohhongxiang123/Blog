# Syntax Analysis

A syntax analyser checks that a program is syntactically well-formed and transforms it from a sequence of tokens to an abstract syntax tree (AST)
- The AST captures the structure of the program
- In later stages, the compiler uses the AST for semantic analysis and code generation

# Context Free Grammar

Programming languages are recursive, and context free grammars are able to define recursive structures
- A context free grammar is given by $G = (T, N, P, S)$
  - A finite set of $T$ terminals
  - A finite set $N$ of non terminals such that $T \cap N = \emptyset$
  - A start symbol $S \in N$
  - A finite set of rules $P$ in the form $A \to s_1 ... s_n$ where $A \in N, n \geq 0$, and $\forall i \in \{1, ..., n\}, s_i \in T \cup N$
    - If $n = 0$, we write the rule as $A \to \lambda$

# Deriving Sentences

$\alpha \to^* \beta$ means that $\beta$ is derived from $\alpha$ in 0 or more steps
- Since there are multiple rules for a nonterminal, we may derive many different sentences from the same initial phrase

The set of all terminal strings that are derivable from the start symbol $S$ is denoted by $L(G)$

If there are multiple non-terminals in a single sentence, we must choose which nonterminal to expand
- A leftmost derivation expands from the left-most non-terminal
- A rightmost derivation expands from the right-most non-terminal

# Parse Trees

A parse tree represents a derivation, and is used to show the structure of the sentence
- Each node in a parse tree is labelled with a symbol
- The root of the tree is the start symbol
- Leaf nodes are labelled with terminal symbols or $\lambda$
- Inner nodes are labelled with non-terminals

A parse tree is generated as follows:
- A node labelled $A$ has children $s_1, ..., s_n$ iff there is a rule $A \to s_1 ... s_n$

# Ambiguous Grammar

A grammar is ambiguous if it has multiple distinct parse trees for the same sentence

# The Parsing Problem

Given a context-free grammar $G = (T, N, S, P)$ and a sentence $w \in T^*$, decide whether $w \in L(G)$

Top-down parsing: Generates a parse tree starting from $S$ and expand the tree by applying rules in a depth-first manner

Bottom-up parsing: Generates a parse tree starting from $w$ and working towards the root. A node is inserted into the tree only after the children have been inserted

## Top Down Parsing

Also known as:
1. Top-down, because it begins from the root of the tree
2. Predictive, because it predicts at each step which rule to use
3. LL(k), because it scans the input from left to right, producing a leftmost derivation, using $k$ symbols of lookahead. We only consider LL(1)
4. Recursive descent, because it can be implemented by a collection of mutually recursive procedures

## Recursive Descent Parsing

In a recursive descent parser, for every non-terminal $A$, there is a corresponding method `parseA` that can parse sentences derived from $A$
- If the grammar has production rules for $S, C, A, B$, then we have the corresponding methods `parseS, parseC, parseA, parseB`

For a grammar

$$
G = \begin{cases}
    S &\to AC & \text{p1}\\
    C &\to c | & \text{p2} \\
        & \lambda & \text{p3} \\
    A &\to aBCd |  & \text{p4} \\
        & BQ & \text{p5} \\
    B &\to bB |  & \text{p6} \\
        & \lambda & \text{p7} \\
    Q &\to q |  & \text{p8} \\
        & \lambda & \text{p9}
\end{cases}
$$

We have parse rules:

```
parseS(ts)
{ 
    // ts is the input token stream
    if (ts.peek() in predict(p1))
        parseA(ts); parseC(ts);
    else /* syntax error */ 
}

parseA(ts)
{ 
    if (ts.peek() in predict(p4))
        match(a); parseB(ts);
        parseC(ts); match(d);
    else if (ts.peek() in predict(p5))
        parseB(ts); parseQ(ts);
}
```

- `peek` examines the next input token without advancing the input
- `match(t)` checks if `ts.peek() == t`

Recursive descent parsing
- Start from the start symbol
- If there is more than 1 rule for $A$, `parseA` inspects the next input token, and chooses a production rule among the rules of $A$ to apply
- The code for applying a production rule is obtained by processing the right side of the rule, symbol by symbol $A \to X_1 \cdots X_n$
- If the next symbol at $X_i$ is a terminal $t$, check whether the next input token is $t$
- If it is a nonterminal $B$, continue recursively parsing $B$ using `parseB`
- The code for applying a production rule $A \to \lambda$ will do nothing, and simply return

Recursive descent parsers use a lookahead of 1 token to determine which rule to use
- Lookahead has to be nonambiguous - there should not be more than 1 rule for the same nonterminal whose RHS starts with the same token

A grammar which fulfills this condition is an $LL(1)$ grammar
- A language for which there exists an $LL(1)$ grammar is an $LL(1)$ language

## Computing `predict(p)`

Consider a grammar rule $X \to X_1 \cdots X_m, m \geq 0$
- The set of tokens that `predict(p)` returns includes
  - The set of first tokens in sentences derivable from $X_1 \cdots X_m$
    - The set of first tokens in $X_1$
    - If $X_1$ is empty, the set of first tokens in $X_2$, and so on
    - Note that if $m = 0$, the set is empty
  - If $X_1 \cdots X_m$ is empty, the set of first tokens that may follow $X$


For example, $A \to BQ$
- The set of first tokens in sentences that may be derived from $BQ$ is $\{b, q\}$
- Because $BQ$ may be empty, the set of first tokens that may follow $A$ is $\{c, \$\}$

The set of tokens returned by `predict(p)` is `{b, q, c, $}`

For $A \to aBCd$, the set of tokens `predict(p)` returns is `{a}`

These `predict` calls determine which rule to use

To compute the set of tokens that predict rule p, we need to know
1. Whether a non-terminal can derive empty
2. The RHS of a rule can derive empty

2 boolean arrays are used
1. `symbolsDeriveEmpty[X]` for $X \in N$
2. `rulesDeriveEmpty[p]` for $p \in P$

For our grammar 

$$
G = \begin{cases}
    S &\to AC & \text{p1}\\
    C &\to c | & \text{p2} \\
        & \lambda & \text{p3} \\
    A &\to aBCd |  & \text{p4} \\
        & BQ & \text{p5} \\
    B &\to bB |  & \text{p6} \\
        & \lambda & \text{p7} \\
    Q &\to q |  & \text{p8} \\
        & \lambda & \text{p9}
\end{cases}
$$

`symbolsDeriveEmpty`:

```
{
    S: true,
    C: true,
    A: true,
    B: true,
    Q: true
}
```

`rulesDeriveEmpty`:

```
{
    p1: true,
    p2: false,
    p3: true,
    p4: false,
    p5: true,
    p6: false,
    p7: true,
    p8: false,
    p9: true,
}
```

```
predict(p: X -> X1 X2 ... Xm) // returns a set of tokens
{ 
    ans = first(X1 X2 ... Xm);
    if ruleDerivesEmpty[p] then // whenX1 X2 ... Xm may be empty
        ans = ans âˆª follow(X);
    
    return ans;
}
```

`first(X1 X2 ... Xm)` returns the set of first tokens in sentences derivable from X1 X2 ... Xm . Formally:

$$
first(X_1 X_2 ... X_m) = {t \in T | \exists w \in T^*, [X_1 X_2 ... X_m \to^* t_w] }
$$

```
first(X1 X2 ... Xm) // returns a set of tokens
{ 
    for each nonterminal X in the language
    visitedFirst[X] = false;
    ans = internalFirst(X1 X2 ... Xm);
    return ans;
}
```

Main ideas for `internalFirst`:
- If $X_1 ... X_m = \lambda$, there is no first token. Return $\emptyset$
- if $X_1$ is a terminal symbol, the first token is this symbol. Return $\{X_1\}$. For example, `internalFirst(bB) = [b]`
- If $X_1$ is a nonterminal
  - `result = empty`
  - if `visitedFirst[X1]` is false
    - Set `visitedFirst[X1]` to true
    - Look at every rule for `X1` and find the first tokens of each rule, and add to result
  - If `symbolDerivesEmpty[X1]`, find the first token of `X2...Xm` and add to result
  - Return result

# Stereo Vision and Parallax

Computer stereo vision is the extraction of 3D information from digital images, such as those obtained by a CCD camera. By comparing information about a scene from two vantage points, 3D information can be extracted by examining the relative positions of objects in the two panels. This is similar to the biological process of stereopsis.

Parallax is a displacement in the apparent position of an object viewed along 2 different lines of sight. It is measured by the angle/semi-angle of inclination between those 2 lines

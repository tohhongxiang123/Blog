# Introduction to Computer Memory

There are many types of computer memory. The most common we currently use:

### Semiconductor-based
- Solid-state drive
- SODIMM
- SD, microSD
- Thumbdrives

### Magnetic-based
- Magnetic Hard Drive

# Memory within Computer Systems

In a computer system, there are also many types of memory, all of which serve different purposes

### Processors

Contains data related to the current running program. Data does not persist after power is lost.

- Registers
- Cache
- Internal Memory

### System Memory

Contains Code/Data used during run-time. Subset of the active program running. Data does not persist after power is lost.

- NOR/NAND Flash Memory
- DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)
- SRAM (Static Random Access Memory)

### Storage Memory

Contains all code/data of all programs and data in the computer system. Data persists even after power is lost.

- HDD (Hard Drive)
- SSD (Solid State Drive)
- Storage ICs (Storage Integrated Chips)

# Memory - Cost vs Function Trade-Off
- The memory and storage devices may be organised like a pyramid
- The pinnacle has the **fastest** access times, but are also **expensive**
- Memory with slower access times are usually cheaper, hence more storage is available

# Volatile vs Non-Volatile Memory

### Volatile
- Data lost when power is lost
- Temporary storage
- Typically used as system memory
- E.g. SRAM and DRAM

### Non-Volatile
- Data retained even if electric power is removed
- Permanent storage
- Typically used as main storage
- E.g. FLASH, magnetic hard disks

# Semiconductor Memories

- Memories based on semiconductor integrated circuits
- Used as processor internal memories and system memory in a computer system
- Processor internal memories
  - Registers
  - Buffers
  - Cache
  - Internal System and Storage Memory (SRAM, DRAM, Flash based memories)

Types of semiconductor memories include
- SRAM
- DRAM
- Flash Memory
- Solid State Drives (Based on Flash Memories)

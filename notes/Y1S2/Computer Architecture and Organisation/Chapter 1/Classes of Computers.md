# What is a Computer?

-   No definitive way to classify computers
-   Broadly, we can classify them into 3 categories
    -   Supercomputer
    -   Microcomputer
    -   Embedded system

### Supercomputer

-   Large, powerful and expensive computers
-   High computational performance, operate on large data sizes for high precision calculations
-   e.g. The Titan Supercomputer ant Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA. Computaional peak performance around 17-27 petaflops
-   Generally scalable by adding more processors
-   Used for weather forecasting, simulation of complex physical systems

### Microcomputers

-   Micropprocessor as a processing unit and external memory and peripheral chip support
-   E.g. high-end server, personal computers, notebooks

### Embedded systems

-   Compact devices that employ a single-chip (microcontroller) containing the processing unit
-   Usually only has a single use
-   E.g. thermometer, mp3

# Early Days of the Digital Computer

-   Major progress made during WWII (1940)
-   Copmuter research funded by the War Department
-   Solve problems related to ballistics

### Harvard and Von Neumann

-   2 major classes of computer architecture emerged
-   **Harvard architecture**, named after Harvard series of relay calculators developed by Howard Aiken at Harvard University
    -   Two separate memory for code and data
-   **Von Neumann architecture**, developed by John Von Neumann at Princeton University
    -   Single shared memory for both code and data

# Von Neumann

The architecutre that many modern day computers are based on

-   Input -> Central Processing Unit (CPU) -> Output
-   CPU <-> Memory
-   Von Neumann was preferred due to the high cost of memory in the early days of computing, and the shared memory design lowered the costs of building a computer

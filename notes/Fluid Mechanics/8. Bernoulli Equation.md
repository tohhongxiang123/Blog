# Bernoulli Equation

$$
z + \frac{p}{\rho g} + \frac{v^2}{2g} = K
$$

- $z$ refers to elevation
- $p$ refers to pressure at a point
- $\rho$ refers to the density of the fluid
- $g$ refers to gravitational acceleration
- $v$ refers to the speed of the fluid at the point
- $K$ is a constant

Applies to ideal fluids, with the following restrictions
- Frictionless flow
- Steady flow
- Incompressible flow
- Flow along a streamline

## Conservation of Energy

Energy per unit weight (J/N or m):

$$
\frac{p}{\rho g} + \frac{v^2}{2g} + z = K
$$

Energy per unit mass (J/kg)

$$
\frac{p}{\rho} + \frac{v^2}{2} + gz = K 
$$

Energy per unit volume (J/m^3)

$$
p + \frac{\rho v^2}{2} + \rho g z = K
$$

## Application of Bernoulli Equation

For 2 points, $A$ and $B$, along a streamline

$$
z_A + \frac{p_A}{\rho g} + \frac{v_A^2}{2g} = z_B + \frac{p_B}{\rho g} + \frac{v_B^2}{2g}
$$

# Derivation of Bernoulli Equation

- Apply $F = ma$ to a fluid particle in motion
- Consider a streamline in plane flow

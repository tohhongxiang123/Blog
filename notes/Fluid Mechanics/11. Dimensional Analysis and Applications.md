![Common Dimensions](https://slidetodoc.com/presentation_image_h/a61ea79a14ef73d5cb04eb5d4b21de5b/image-15.jpg)

There are also a few common dimensionless groups

![Common Dimensionless Groups](https://d2vlcm61l7u1fs.cloudfront.net/media%2Fd4e%2Fd4eff19f-ec52-4717-8240-41dc54da65d4%2Fphpp4x5Fd.png)

Specifically for fluid mechanics, these are the few we will focus on

# Reynold's Number

Reynold's number is the ratio of **inertia force** on an element of fluid to the **viscous force** on the element. It is defined by the following formula:

$$
Re = \frac{\rho V L}{\mu}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $V$ is the velocity of the fluid with respect to the object it is flowing in, $L$ is the characteristic linear dimension (in $m$), and $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid

Reynold's number is the ratio of the momentum forces (how much energy there is in the motion of the fluid) and the viscous forces (how resistant the fluid is to motion)
- The characteristic length is the dimension that defines the length scale of a physical system
- It is usually the smallest available length scale. For example, if a fluid flows through a pipe of radius $R$ and length $L$, if $R/L << 1$, then $R$ is the characteristic length scale, while if $R/L >> 1$, then $L$ is the characteristic length scale
    - We use the smallest length scale because the gradients there are usually the largest, generating most of the mass, heat or momentum transport

Regarding the physical significance of $Re$,
- $Re$ is important because these 2 forces are important in flow
- At low $Re$, viscous force is dominant over inertia force, fluid tends to stick together, laminar flow occurs
- At high $Re$, inertia force is dominant over viscous force, fluid fails to stick together, turbulent flow occurs
- $Re$ is usually significant, with or without a free surface. It can be neglected only in flow regions away from high-velocity gradients, such as solid surfaces, jets or wakes

## Derivation of Reynold's Number

Consider a cubic control volume with length $L$, through which a fluid of density $\rho$ is flowing with velocity $v$

$$
\begin{aligned}
Re &= \frac{\text{Inertial force}}{\text{Viscous force}} \\
&= \frac{ma}{\mu \frac{du}{dy}A} \\
&= \frac{\rho V \frac{v}{t}}{\mu \frac{v}{L} L^2} & (m = \rho V, a = \frac{v}{t}) \\
&= \frac{\rho L^2}{t \mu} & (V = L^3) \\
&= \frac{\rho L v}{\mu} & (\frac{L}{t} = v)
\end{aligned}
$$


# Froude Number

Froude's number $Fr$ is the ratio of inertia force on a fluid element to its weight

$$
Fr =  \frac{V}{\sqrt{gL}}
$$

where $V$ is the velocity of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $L$ is the characteristic linear dimension

$Fr$ shows how well the fluid can flow due to gravity acting on the fluid. $Fr$ is important in flows with a free surface where gravity is important, such as open channel flows. It is usually insignificant if there is no free surface.

## Derivation of Froude's Number

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\text{Inertial force}}{\text{Gravity force}} &= \frac{ma}{mg} \\
&= \frac{V/t}{g} \\
&= \frac{V/(L/V)}{g} & (t = \frac{L}{V}) \\
&= \frac{V^2}{gL}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since this is a dimensionless constant, we can take the square root, and let that ratio be $Fr$

$$
Fr = \frac{V}{\sqrt{gL}}
$$

# Euler's Number

Euler's number is the ratio of pressure force on a fluid element to the inertial force

$$
Eu = \frac{p}{\rho V^2} = \frac{\Delta p}{\rho V^2}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure force on the fluid, $\Delta p$ is the pressure difference in the fluid, $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, and $V$ is the velocity of the fluid

Euler's number is important in flows where pressure or pressure differences between 2 points are important

# Cauchy Number and Mach Number

Cauchy's number ($Ca$) is the ratio of inertial force to compressibility force

$$
Ca = \frac{\rho V^2}{E}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $V$ is the velocity of the fluid, and $E$ is the bulk modulus (relative change in volume) of the fluid

Mach's number, $Ma$ is the ratio of the velocity of a fluid to the velocity of sound in that fluid

$$
Ma = \frac{V}{c}, c = \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}}
$$

where $V$ is the velocity of the fluid, $c$ is the speed of sound in the fluid, $E$ is the bulk modulus of the fluid, and $\rho$ is the density of the fluid

Both Mach's number and Cauchy's number are related by the following:

$$
Ma^2 = Ca
$$

Either Mach's number or Cauchy's number is used when fluid compressibility is important. If $Ma < 0.3$, the compressibility of the fluid can be neglected

# Strouhal's Number

Strouhal's Number is the ratio of inertial force caused by flow unsteadiness (local acceleration) to the inertial force caused by convective acceleration

$$
St = \frac{fL}{V}
$$

where $f$ is the frequency of oscillation, $L$ is the charcteristic linear dimension, and $V$ is the velocity of the fluid

Strouhal's number is important in unsteady, oscillating flows

# Weber's Number

Weber's number is the ratio of inertial force to surface tension force acting on a fluid element

$$
We = \frac{\rho V^2 L}{\sigma}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $V$ is the velocity of the fluid, $L$ is the characteristic linear dimension, and $\sigma$ is the surface tension of the fluid

Weber's number is important when there is an interface between 2 fluids, and surface tension may be important. This usually occurs if the surface curvature is comparable in size to the liquid's depth

# Dimensional Analysis

Dimensional analysis is a powerful method in fluid mechanics which allows analysis to be performed in an organised, meaningful and systematic manner

For example, if we want to study the steady flow of an incompressible fluid flowing in a long smooth walled horizontal pipe, the engineer needs to know the flow pressure drop per unit length of the pipeline

1. Identify the important vairables (or factors) that affect the pressure drop per unit length in the flow, a functional relationshiop can be formed as follows

$$
\Delta p_l = \frac{\Delta p}{L} = f(D, \rho, \mu, V)
$$

2. Group the variables into a dimensionless group, and run experiments to figure out the relationship between the variables

## Buckingham $\Pi$ Theorem

Buckingham's theorem states that if an equation involving $n$ variables is dimensionally homogeneous, then, it can be reduced to a relationship among $n - m$ independent dimensionless parameters, where $m$ is the minimum number of reference dimensions required to describe the variables
- A dimensionally homogeneous equation is an equation where the dimensions of the left hand side are identical to the dimensions on the right hand side
- These dimensionless paramters are called $\Pi$ terms

For example, a problem involving $n$ variables can be expressed generally as 

$$
u_1 = f(u_2, u_3, ..., u_n)
$$

The equation above must be dimensionally homogeneous. Then, Buckingham's $\Pi$ theorem states that the equation above can be rearranged in terms of dimensionless $\Pi$ terms as follows

$$
\Pi_1 = \phi(\Pi_2, \Pi_3, ..., \Pi_{n - m})
$$

The number of $\Pi$ terms that can be formed is $n-m$, where $m$ is the minimum number (typically 1, 2, or 3) of reference dimensions required to describe the original list of variables
- The reference dimensions are $M$ (mass), $L$ (length), and $T$ (time). For some cases, only 2 (e.g. $L, T$) or 1 (e.g. $L$) are needed

## Determination of $\Pi$ Terms

For the determination of the $\Pi$ terms, we use the **method of repeating variables**

- List all variables involved in the problem, say $n$ variables. Typically, the variables include
    - Geometry (e.g. pipe diameter, or other length dimension)
    - Fluid or material property (fluid viscosity, density)
    - External effects (pressure, velocity, gravity)
- Express each variable in terms of its basic dimensions in $M, L, T$. E.g. velocity is $V = \frac{L}{T}$, force $F = MLT^{-2}$
- Choose the appropriate number of repeating variables $m$ for the problem, and $m$ can be 1, 2, or 3 variables. Most problems would require $m = 3$
- Number of $\Pi$ terms would be $n - m$
- The repeating variabels must be chosen from the list of $n$ variables, identified in the problem
    - One repeating variable is chosen to represent each of the $M$, $L$ or $T$, and each must be a different variable. E.g. if you use velocity (m/s) to represent $T$, then it cannot be used to represent length $L$ and vice versa
    - The **dependent variable cannot be a repeating variable**, and the **repeating variables cannot be grouped to form a dimensionless constant**
- To form a $\Pi$ term, pick one of the non-repeating variables and multiply together with the product of the repeating variables, with each of the latter raised to an exponent such that the combination becomes dimensionless, hence

$$
\Pi = u_i u_1^a u_2^b u_3^c
$$

where $u_1, u_2, u_3$ are the chosen repeating variables, and $a, b, c$ are determined such that the combination in $\Pi$ is dimensionless

- Repeat this step for all remaining non-repeating variables in the problem. Check that all $\Pi$ terms formed are dimensionless
- Finally, the functional relationship is $\Pi_1 = \phi(\Pi_2, \Pi_3, ..., \Pi_n)$

### Example 1

Find a general relationship for the pressure drop $\Delta p$ per unit length $L$ in steady flow (with velocity $V$, fluid with density $\rho$, and viscosity $\mu$) along a smooth horizontal pipe (with diameter $D$)

1. Identify all variables (all given in this case), $\Delta p_l = f(D, \mu, \rho, V)$
2. Express variables in terms of basic dimensions $M$, $L$, $T$
    - $\Delta p_l = \frac{\Delta p}{L} = [ML^{-2}T^{-2}]$
    - $D = [L]$
    - $\rho = [ML^{-3}]$
    - $\mu = [ML^{-1}T^{-1}]$
    - $V = [LT^{-1}]$
3. We select 3 repeating variables: say, $\rho [M], D [L], V [T]$, and rule 1: they do not form a dimensionless group, and rule 2: they do not include any dependent variables ($\Delta p$)
    - Hence, the number of $\Pi$ terms is $n - m = 5 - 3 = 2$
4. Form $\Pi$ terms:

$$
\Pi_1 = \Delta p_l D^a V^b \rho^c
$$

We want to make this whole thing dimensionless, hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
M^0 L^0 T^0 = (ML^{-2}T^{-2})(L)^a (LT^{-1})^b(ML^{-3})^c \\
M^0 L^0 T^0 = M^{1 + c} L^{-2 + a + b - 3c} T^{-2 -b}
\end{aligned}
$$

Solving simultaneously for $a, b, c$, we get $a = 1, b = -2, c = -1$. Hence, $\Pi_1 = \frac{\Delta p_l D}{V^2 \rho}$

5. Repeat for $\Pi_2 = \mu D^a V^b \rho^c = \frac{\mu}{DV\rho}$
6. General relationship: $\Pi_1 = \phi(\Pi_2)$

$$
\frac{\Delta p_l D}{V^2 \rho} = \phi\left(\frac{\mu}{DV\rho}\right)
$$

Notice that the right side of the equation is the inverse of Reynold's number, and we can actually just take $\Pi_2' = \frac{1}{\Pi_2}$ and use $\Pi_2'$ as part of the equation instead, since $\Pi_2$ is a dimensionless variable
- Since all the $\Pi$s are dimensionless, we are free to replace any of the $\Pi$s with a power of that $\Pi$, or by a product with the other $\Pi$s, provided we retain the same number of dimensionless groups
- We usually only replace $\Pi$s when it is convenient (For this case, since we can just take the reciprocal and use it as Reynold's number)

$$
\frac{\Delta p_l D}{V^2 \rho} = \phi\left(\frac{DV\rho}{\mu}\right)
$$

## Additional Comments for $\Pi$ theorem

- Selection of correct variables involved in the problem, typically
    - Geometry: Lengths
    - Fluid and material property: density, viscosity
    - External effects: pressure, velocity, gravity
- All variables are independent
- Reference dimensions are $M, L, T$
- The required number of $\Pi$ terms is fixed: i.e. $n - m$ terms
- Note that the set of $\Pi$ terms derived from dimensional analysis is **not unique**, and is dependent on the choice of the repeating variables. I.e., if a different set of repeating variables are used, then the $\Pi$ terms are different
- In this sense, DA is flexible and the $\Pi$ terms derived can bhe adjusted/altered as long as it remains dimensionless. Adjustments must be such that the new $\Pi$ terms are more representative of the problem to be solved
- To choose repeating variables, choose a set of variables which, by themselves, cannot form a dimensionless group

## Interpretation of Experimental Data

- DA helps in the efficient handling, interpretation and correlation of experimental data
- DA provides the $\Pi$ terms (dimensionless groups) describing the phenomenon, not the specific relationship among the groups
- Experimental data is required to determine the specific relationshipos between the $\Pi$ terms
- The ease of determining the relationship depends on the number of $\Pi$ terms involved, and the nature of the experiments

### One $\Pi$ Term

If there is only 1 $\Pi$ term, dimensionaly analysis reveals the following functional relationship

$$
\Pi_1 = k
$$

for some constant $k$

For example, to find the drag force of a sphere falling slowly through a viscous fluid,

$$
F_D = f(d, V, \mu)
$$

From DA, $\Pi_1 = \frac{F_D}{\mu V d} = k$

Hence, $F_D = k \mu V d$

The value of $k$ can be determined from experiments, or in this case the theoretical solution gives $k = 3\pi$ (Stokes law)

### Two $\Pi$ terms

For 2 $\Pi$ terms, the general functional relationshipo is of the form 

$$
\Pi_1 = \phi(\Pi_2)
$$

This function $\phi$ can be determined from experiments.

For example, let us revisit the pressure drop per unit length in flow along smooth horizontal pipe

$$
\frac{D \Delta p_l}{\rho V^2} = \phi \left( \frac{\rho V D}{\mu} \right)
$$

By plotting $\Pi_1$ against $\Pi_2$, experimental data shows a log plot, hence we can conclude that $\phi(n) = k \log n$ for some constant $k$

### Three or More $\Pi$ Terms Problem

As the number of $\Pi$ terms increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to display the experimental results graphically to establish the relationshipo. We will learn a 3$\Pi$ problem in Moody Diagrams later.

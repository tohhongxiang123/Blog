# Static and Dynamic Pressure

- Static pressure is pressure in a fluid that is stationary
- Dynamic pressure is the pressure in a fluid due to its motion

# Concept of Stagnation Point and Stagnation Pressure

![](https://www.princeton.edu/~maelabs/hpt/mechanics/b123.gif)

- At the stagnation point, the pressure is the largest along a given streamline
- This is because the kinetic energy ($\frac{V^2}{2g}$) is converted into a pressure rise

# Measurement of Static and Dynamic Pressure

Let $(1)$ be the point directly under the static pressure tube, at the same height as the stagnation point. Let $(2)$ be the point right in front of the bent pipe. This point is the stagnation point because $V_2 = 0$

Let $h_1$ be the height from the top of the water level above $(1)$. The static pressure at $(1)$ is given by:

$$
p_1 = h_1 \rho g
$$

Let $h_2$ be the height from the top of the water level above $(2)$. Similarly, the static pressure at $(2)$ is:

$$
p_2 = h_2 \rho g
$$

By using bernoulli's equation between $(1)$ and $(2)$, 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{p_1}{\rho g} + \frac{V_1^2}{2g} + z_1 &= \frac{p_2}{\rho g} + \frac{V_2^2}{2g} + z_2 \\
\frac{p_1}{\rho g} + \frac{V_1^2}{2g} &= \frac{p_2}{\rho g} \\
p_2 - p_1 &=  \rho \frac{V_1^2}{2} \\
(h_2 - h_1) \rho g &= \rho \frac{V_1^2}{2} \\
\frac{V_1^2}{2g} &= h_2 - h_1
\end{aligned}
$$

We can see that the velocity head of the stagnation point is just the difference in heights

# Pitot Static Tube - for Velocity Measurement

- In practice, we do not install 2 tubes, but utilise a pitot-static tube to measure the difference between stagnation pressure ($p_2$) and static pressure ($p_1$)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{p_1}{\rho g} + \frac{V_1^2}{2g} = \frac{p_2}{\rho g} \\
V_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2(p_2 - p_1)}{\rho}} 
\end{aligned}
$$


# Energy Line and Hydraulic Grade Line

Used to graphically interpret Bernoulli eq by noting that
- Bernoulli equation is an energy equation representing the partitioning of energy of an inviscid (frictionless), incompressible, steady flow
- Bernoulli's equation implies that the sum of various energies of the fluid remains constant as the fluid flows from one point to another

# Plots of EL and HGL

- Energy line: A plot of total head ($z + \frac{p}{\rho g} + \frac{V^2}{2g}$) along a streamline
    - For steady, inviscid, incompressible flow, EL remains constant (No energy loss)
- Hydraulic Grade Line (HGL) - A plot of piezometric head ($z + \frac{p}{\rho g}$) along a streamline
    - Difference between HGL and EL at a point is the kinetic head

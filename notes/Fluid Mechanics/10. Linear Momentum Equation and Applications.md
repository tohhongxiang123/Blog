# Linear Momentum Equation and Applications

- With the law of mass conservation, we can calculate how much of a fluid enters and leaves a control volume
- We will now derive Newton's second law of motion 
- We will study hydrodynamic forces caused by changes in velocity magnitude/direction

# Difference between Hydrostatic and Hydrodynamic Forces

Imagine a gate with water on one side. If the gate is closed, the force on the gate is due to static pressure (hydrostatic pressure)

$$
F_s = \rho g h_c A
$$

When a gate is open, water flows out past the gate. The force on the gate is due to both

1. Hydrostatic pressure
2. Momentum change

# Linear Momentum Equation for a System

Hydrodynamic force is governed by Newton's second law of motion. Applying the law to a fixed mass, for an object of mass $m$ experiencing a force $F$,

$$
F = ma = m \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d(mV)}{dt} = \frac{dp}{dt}
$$

$a$ is the acceleration of the object, $v$ is the velocity of the object, and $p$ is the momentum of the object, where $p = mv$

Force is the rate of change of momentum

# Momentum Flow Rate

Consider uniform velocity $V$, normal to area $A$. The flow passing through $A$ can be described using

- Volume flow rate: $Q = AV$
- Mass flow rate: $\dot{m} = \frac{dm}{dt} = \rho \frac{dV}{dt} = \rho Q$
- Momentum flow rate: $\frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{d(mV)}{dt} = V \rho Q$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dp}{dt} &= \frac{d(mV)}{dt} \\
&= V\frac{dm}{dt} + m\frac{dV}{dt} \\
&= V \frac{dm}{dt} &(\frac{dV}{dt} = 0 \text{ for steady flow}) \\
&= V \rho Q
\end{aligned}
$$

# Linear Momentum Equation for a Control Volume

In a control volume, given net force $F$ acting on a fluid in the control volume in the x-direction

Momentum changes per unit time: 

- Momentum gain due to inflow: $p_{in} = \rho Q_{in} V_{in}$
- Momentum gain due to force: $F$
- Momentum loss due to outflow: $p_{out} = \rho Q_{out} V_{out}$

Hence, 

$$
F + \rho Q_{in} V_{in} = \rho Q_{out} V_{out} \\
F = \rho Q_{out} V_{out} - \rho Q_{in} V_{in}
$$

If a control volume has multiple inflows and outflows, then

$$
\sum F_x = \sum (\rho Q V_x)_{out} - \sum (\rho Q V_x)_{in}
$$

The net force on a fixed control volume is the sum of outlet momentum flow rates - sum of internal momentum flow rates

# Net Force Acting on Fluid in CV

- Net force acting on a fluid in a CV = sum of forces acting on the fluid's surface + weight of fluid in CV
- On each surface, the force can be resolved into 2 perpendicular components, pressure (perpendicular) and shear (tangential)
- For ideal frictionless fluid, shear force = 0

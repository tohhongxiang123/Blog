# Classic Software Mistakes

There are 4 classic software mistakes

1. People-related mistakes
2. Process-related mistakes
3. Product-related mistakes
4. Technology-related mistakes

## People

- In a team, skills range very differently from people to people
- Individual ability, individual motivation, team ability and team motivation are factors that affect productivity
- Greater than 10-to-1 differences in productivity among individuals with different levels of experience
- 10 to 1 differences in productivity among individuals with the same level of experience
- 5 to 1 differences in productivity among groups with different level of experience
- 2.5 to 1 difference in productivity among groups with similar level of experience
- This shows that groups made up of individuals with similar levels of experience are the most productive

People-related issues include
- Undermined motivation
    - Avoid doing things that undermine the motivation of the team
- Weak personnel
    - Hire only the best, never hire from the bottom of the barrel
- Uncontrolled problem employees
    - Not sacking problem employees result in lower motivation from the rest of the team
- Heroics
    - Developers who work extremely long hours on the project
    - Heroics threaten the schedule because slips are not detected until too late
    - Be steady and consistent with regular progress reports
- Adding people to a project late
    - Adding more people to a project that is behind schedule does more damage than doing nothing
- Unrealistic expectations
    - Deadlines that are too short, or requirements that are too large, can reduce motivation and cause deadline misses
- Noisy, crowded offices
    - Workers who work in quiet private offices are more productive and less distracted than noisy crowded offices
- Friction between developers and clients
    - Usually caused by poor communication, or overly demanding clients etc
    - Results in poorly understood requirements and poorly built systems
    - In the worst case, clients refuse to accept the product
- Lack of user input
    - Projects without early or regular user inputs are susceptible to misinterpreting user requirements
    - If detected too late, are very costly to fix
- Wishful thinking
    - Knowing that something cannot be done, but agreeing to do it anyways
    - Wishful thinking in the beginning of a project can lead to big blowups before the end
- Lack of stakeholder buy in
    - A project can only succeed if all the stakeholders contribute their heart to it
- Lack of effective project sponsorship
    - Every project needs at least one person who is capable of saying "NO" when another high-level manager tries to push an unrealistic deadline or make changes that undermine the project
    - These high-level sponsors should support aspects such as realistic planning, change control/practices etc
- Politics placed over substance
    - Do not place office politics over results
    - This might be good short term, however will direct the project towards failure in the long term

## Process

- Process can refer to both management and technological methodologies
- Companies that focus on processes have cut their time-to-market by half, and reduced cost and defects by a factor of 3 to 10

Aspects of process management include
- Rework avoidance - Orient your process to prevent doing things twice
- Quality assurance
    - Ensure product has an acceptable level of quality
    - Detect errors early, reducing time and cost to fix those errors
- Development fundamentals
- Risk management
- Resource targeting
- Life cycle planning
- Customer orientation

Process related mistakes include
- Overly optimistic schedules
    - Underscopes the project, causes short-cutting in requirement analysis and testing
    - Also has detrimental impact on staff morale and productivity
- Insufficient risk management
    - Failure to manage risk will cause projects to fail easily
- Contractor failure
    - Contractors frequently deliver late or poor-quality work
    - Must maintain good contractor relationship, or else contractors can slow down a project
- Insufficient planning
- Abandonment of planning under pressure
- Wasted time during fuzzy front-end
    - This is the time spent in the beginning of the project, setting up budgets, gathering requirements etc
    - Ensure this stage is short and intense, so that requirements are clear and concrete, and there is enough budget for the project later
- Shortchanged upstream activities
    - Do not skip activities that don't directly create code, such as requirement analysis or testing
    - Fixing bugs in the middle of a project is a lot more costlier than avoiding the bugs entirely
- Inadequate design
- Shortchanged quality assurance
    - Projects in a hurry usually skip QA
    - Activities such as testing, designing and code reviews are skipped, which will cost more to fix the problems later
- Insufficient management control
    - Controls are required to provide timely warnings of schedule slips and other problems
    - Controls are usually abandoned when trouble occurs, such as deadlines approaching
- Premature or Overly frequent convergence
    - Tying together all the components of a software too early, or too frequently results in a lot of wasted time
- Omitting necessary tasks for estimates
    - People rarely keep records of previous projects, and forget about less visible tasks
    - These tasks add up, and can cost a lot of time and effort, and can cause teams to miss deadlines
- Planning to catch up later
    - When late, developers usually just plan to catch up later
    - However, projects usually move too fast for developers to catch up
    - Schedules have to be changed to meet changing requirements
- Code like hell programming
    - Coding and fixing issues along the way, without planning and design
    - Will cause problems in the long run, and as project develops, harder to fix issues

## Product

- If you can reduce a product's feature set, you can reduce a product's schedule
- 80/20 rule: 80% of the product takes 20% of the time
- Product size: The effort required to build a product increases a lot faster than the increase in the size of the product
- Product characteristics: Hard to reach goals such as performance, memory usage, etc. will take longer

Product related mistakes include
- Requirements gold-plating
    - Adding unneccessary features
    - Users are usually less interested in complex features, but these complex and unneccessary features take a long time to develop
- Feature creep
    - As a project continues, requirements are always changing, and features are always added. This adds more time required to complete the project
- Developer gold-plating
    - Developers like to play with new technologies, which are unneccessary to a project
    - Developers also like adding features just because they are "neat" and "cool", which wastes time
- Push-me pull-me negotiation
    - Some managers decide to add in new additional tasks even though they already know the project is running behind schedule
- Research oriented development
    - If your project pushes the state of the art limits, requires new algorithms or hardware design, then you are doing research, not development
    - Research schedules are usually very problematic, and are wrong for development

## Technology

- Changing to more effective tools can be a fast way to improve development speed
- Changing from low-level to high-level languages was one of the most important changes in software development
- Choosing tools effectively and managing risks involved are essential

Technology related mistakes include
- Silver-bullet syndrome
    - Don't expect new technologies being used to solve every single one of your problems
- Lack of automated source-code control
    - Exposes projects to needless risks
- Switching tools in the middle of a project
    - Upgrading compilers, operating systems in the middle of a project may cause existing features to break
    - Installation, learning the new system, fixing incompatibilities will all waste time
- Overestimated savings from new tools/methods
    - Use of new technology can save some time, however there is still a learning curve to learn these technologies
    - Teams seldom dramatically improve productivity. Aim for slow consistent improvements

# Merge k Sorted Lists

Problem can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/). The problem description is as follows:

> Given `k` lists, each sorted in ascending order, merge all the lists into a single list, sorted by ascending order

# Procedure

1. Use a min-heap to keep track of which list has the smallest starting element
2. We pop the list out of the heap
3. We pop the first element of the list, and put it into the output
4. With the modified list, we push it back into the min heap
5. Repeat until all elements are complete

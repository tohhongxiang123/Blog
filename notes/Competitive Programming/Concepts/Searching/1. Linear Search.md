# Linear Search

Given an array `arr[]` of `n` elements, write a function to search for a given element `x` in `arr`

This is a simple example of linear search. 

1. We start from the leftmost element of `arr` and one by one compare `x` with each element
2. If `x` matches with an element, we return the index 
3. If `x` does not match the element, we return -1

```python
def search(arr, numberOfElements, targetElement):
    for i in range(0, numberOfElements):
        if arr[i] == targetElement:
            return i

    return -1
```

# Time Complexity Analysis

This algorithm runs in $O(n)$ time, because for $n$ elements, the worst case occurs when we have to compare every single element in the array

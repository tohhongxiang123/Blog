# Primality Test

Given a positive integer, check if the number is prime or not. A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Examples of first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, ...}

# Solution

Initially, we can use a linear scan and check that all numbers from $2$ to $n-1$ cannot perfectly divide $n$

```python
def isPrime(n):
    # 0 and 1 are not prime
    if n <= 1:
        return False
        
    # Check that all numbers from 2 to n-1 do not divide n
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False

    return True
```

# Time Complexity 

This time complexity is $O(n)$ since we do a linear scan of all numbers from $2$ to $n-1$

# Further Optimisations

1. We do not have to check up to $n-1$, but only numbers $\leq \sqrt{n}$, since a larger factor of $n$ would be a multiple of a smaller factor that was already checked
2. The algorithm can be further checked that all primes are of the form $6k \pm 1$ with the exception of 2 and 3. Hence, we only need to look through all numbers in the form $6k \pm 1$

## Proof for (1)

If a number $n$ is not prime, it can be split into 2 factors $n = ab$, but $a$ and $b$ cannot both be larger than $\sqrt{n}$, since $\sqrt{n} \sqrt{n} = n$. Therefore in any factorisation of $n$, if we cannot find any factors that are less than $\sqrt{n}$, then $n$ is prime


## Proof for (2)

We know that all integers can be expressed in the form $6k + i$, for some integer $i = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$. However, $6k, 6k + 2, 6k + 4$ are all divisible by 2, and $6k + 3$ is divisible by 3. We are left with $6k + 1$ and $6k + 5 = 6(k + 1) - 1 = 6j - 1$. Hence, all primes can be expressed in the form $6k \pm 1$

Now, for the code

```python
from math import ceil, sqrt

def isPrime(n):
    # 1 is not a prime
    if n == 1:
        return False

    # Checking for primes between 2-7
    # So that the loop will work
    if n == 2 or n == 3 or n == 5 or n == 7:
        return True
        
    # Checking primes that are not in the form 6k +- 1
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    
    # 6k +- 1 <= sqrt(n)
    for i in range(1, ceil((sqrt(n) - 1)/6) + 1):
        if n % (6*i - 1) == 0:
            return False
        
        if n % (6*i + 1) == 0:
            return False

    return True
```

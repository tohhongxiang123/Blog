# Buoyancy, Flotation and Stability

# Buoyant Force

- Net upward vertical force acting on a stationary body that is completely or partially submerged in a fluid
- Upward force acts through **center of displaced volume of fluid**

## Buoyant Force: Floating or Submerged Body

$$
F_B = V \rho g
$$

Given $F_B$ is the buoyancy force, $V$ is the volume of fluid displaced, $\rho$ is the density of the fluid displaced, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity

For a floating body,

$$
W_{\text{Object}} = W_{\text{fluid displaced}}
$$

# Stable and Unstable Equilibrium

> A body is in **stable equilibrium** if, when displaced, returns to its original position

> A body is in **unstable equilibrium** if, when displaced, moves to a new equilibrium position

## Stability of a Submerged Body

Consider 2 points: Center of buoyancy (B) and Center of gravity (CG)

![Stable submerged body](https://nptel.ac.in/content/storage2/courses/112104118/lecture-5/images/sub_stable.jpg)

- If CG falls below B, the body is in a stable equilibrium position
  - When you rotate the body by a little bit, the resulting moment tends to restore the body back into its original position

![Unstable submerged body](https://nptel.ac.in/content/storage2/courses/112104118/lecture-5/images/sub_unstable.jpg)

- If CG falls above B, the body is in an unstable equilibrium position
  - When you rotate the body by a little bit, the resulting moment tends to push to body into a new equilibrium position

# Prediction of Stability using a Metacenter

- As a body rotates, centre of buoyancy moves from B to B'
- M is the point where the object seems to rotate around
  - The intersection of BG and B'G
- BM > BG: Stable equilibrium
- BM = BG: Neutral equilibrium
- BM < BG: Unstable equilibrium

# Metacentric Radius

The metacentric radius (or metacentric height) is the distance between the metacenter and the center of mass of an object (The length of BM)

$$
BM = \frac{I_{yy}}{V_{\text{fluid displaced}}}
$$

$I_{yy}$ is the second moment of area about its longer centroidal axis, and $V_{\text{fluid displaced}}$ is the volume of fluid displaced

When a body rotates, we take the second moment of area about its **longer centroidal axis** because that rotation has a **smaller upper limit** before it capsizes. A rectangular ship would more likely roll over its side (along the longer centroidal axis) rather than its front (along the shorter centroidal axis)

## Derivation for Metacentric Radius

![](/public/derivation_for_metacentric_radius.png)

We will solve for an expression for the metacentric radius $R = BM$

The body has rotated an angle $\theta$ clockwise. Because of this rotation, there is a couple generated due to the difference in forces (due to the shaded area)

The couple generated by this shaded area is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
C &= \int dM \\
&= \int x dF \\
&= \int x p dA \\
&= \int x (x \theta \rho g) dA \\
&= \rho g \theta \int x^2 dA
&= \rho g \theta I_{yy}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we also know that the object experiences a buoyancy force $F_B$. Since $F_B$ is now not acting through the center of mass of the object, it causes a moment on the object, which is equal to $C$

$$
\begin{aligned}
C &= F_B \theta R \\
\rho g \theta I_{yy} &= V_{\text{displaced}} \rho g \theta R \\
R &= \frac{I_{yy}}{V_{\text{displaced}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

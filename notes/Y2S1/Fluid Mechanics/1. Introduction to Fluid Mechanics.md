# What is a Fluid?

> In physics, a fluid is a liquid, gas, or other material that continually deforms (flows) under an applied shear stress, or external force.

Both liquids and gases are fluids, while solids are not

## Difference between solid and fluid (liquid and gas)

| Solid                                | Liquid                                                 | Gas                                               |

# How to Describe a Fluid's Behavior

When describing the behavior of fluids, it is not practical to observe individiual molecules

-   For gases at normal pressures and temperatures, the molecule spacing is $10^{-6}$ mm
-   For liquids, the molecule spacing is $10^{-7}$ mm
-   The number of molecules per cubic mm is in the order of $10^{18}$ for gases and $10^{21}$ for liquids

Instead, we choose a point in the fluid to analyse. By choosing a point in a fluid, we take the average of fluid quantities over a tiny volume that contain a large number of molecules

Distance between molecules < Size of Point dimension < Physical dimension of the system

# Force, Length, Time (FLT) System

Sometimes we use the FLT system to describe fluids. Compared to the mass, length, time (MLT) system used to describe other objects.

Newton's law states that

$$
F = MA = M(L/T^2)
$$

| Derived Dimensions   | FLT system    | MLT system    |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Acceleration         | $LT^{-2}$     | $LT^{-2}$     |
| Angle                | $F^0 L^0 T^0$ | $M^0 L^0 T^0$ |
| Angular Acceleration | $T^{-2}$      | $T^{-2}$      |
| Density              | $FL^{-4}T^2$  | $ML^{-3}$     |

These 2 systems are interchangeable.

# International System of Units (SI Units)

Units of basic dimensions

-   Length: metre (m)
-   Time: second (s)
-   Mass: kilogram (kg)
-   Temperature: Kelvin (K)

Units of derived dimensions

-   Force: Newton (N) $1 N = (1 kg)/(1 ms^-2)$
-   Work: Joule (J) $1 J = 1 N.m$
-   Power: Watt (W) $1 W = 1 J/s = 1 N m/s$

etc.

## Major Parameters in Fluid Mechanics

-   $L$, physical **length** of the flow
-   $V$, **velocity** of the flow
-   $p$, **pressure** of the fluid

-   $\rho$, **density** of the fluid, mass per unit volume
-   $\frac{1}{\rho}$, **specific volume**, volume per unit mass

![](https://wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/images/water_ice.png)

-   $\gamma$, **specific weight** or **weight density**, weight per unit volume
    -   $\gamma = \rho g$, where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity
    -   Note how $\rho = \frac{m}{v}$ and $W = mg$, hence $\gamma = \frac{mg}{v} = \frac{W}{v}$, weight per unit volume
-   $SG$, **specific gravity**, ratio of fluid density to water density at $4^oC$.
    -   $SG = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{H_2O @ 4 ^o C}}$
    -   Note that $\rho$ is the density of the fluid being analysed

Both $\rho$ and $\gamma$ measure the "heaviness" of the fluid.

# Viscosity

Viscosity is the measure of the "fluidity" of a fluid

> Viscosity is a quantity expressing the magnitude of internal friction in a fluid, as measured by the force per unit area resisting uniform flow.

Newton's law of viscosity states that

$$
\tau = \mu \frac{du}{dy}
$$

Where $\tau$ is the shear force per unit area, $\mu$ is the viscosity of the fluid, and $\frac{du}{dy}$ is the rate of shear deformation.

## Derivation of Newton's Law of Viscosity

A fluid is placed between 2 wide parallel plates a distance $y$ from each other. The lower plate is fixed, while the upper plate, which has a contact surface area $A$, is exerting a constant tangential force $P$ on the top surface of the fluid.

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/J9oog.png)

-   Tangential force applied on the upper plate = $P$
-   Area of upper fluid contacting the fluid = $A$
-   Shear force per unit area = $\frac{P}{A} = \tau$

Now we shall let $\delta \beta$ be the angle between the y dimension and the velocity gradient. This is known as the **shearing strain**.

![](https://www.materials.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/images/Shear%20strain.png?itok=1u7QjKPu)

> Shear strain is measured as the displacement of the surface $W$ that is in direct contact with the applied shear stress from its original position.

$$
\gamma = \frac{W}{L} = \tan \theta \approx \theta \text{ for small $\theta$}
$$

-   Shearing strain = $\delta \beta$.
-   Given a small time interval $\delta t$
-   Rate of shear strain = $\frac{\delta \beta}{\delta t}$

Since $\delta \beta$ is the angle between the y dimension and the velocity gradient, we can use trigonometry and state

$$
\tan(\delta \beta) = \frac{U \delta t}{y}
$$

Remember that $U$ is a velocity, hence $U \delta t$ is the distance travelled by the top part of the fluid in contact with the plate.

Also, since the angle $\delta \beta$ is small, we can use small angle approximation to say $\tan(\delta \beta) = \delta \beta$

Hence we can say that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\delta \beta &= \frac{U \delta t}{y} \\
\frac{\delta \beta}{\delta t} &= \frac{U}{y}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that:

-   At $y = b$, velocity of fluid particle = speed of upper plate = $U$
-   At $y = 0$, velocity of fluid particle = speed of lower plate = $0$, known as the **"no-slip" condition**

It is experimentally observed that

$$
\tau \propto \frac{\delta \beta}{\delta t}
$$

Using $\mu$ to denote the constant of proportionality,

$$
\tau = \mu \frac{\delta \beta}{\delta t} =  \mu \frac{U}{y} = \mu \frac{du}{dy}
$$

This is newton's law of viscosity. $\frac{du}{dy}$ is **dynamic viscosity** (or absolute viscosity), in Pa.s or $kgm^{-1}s^{-1}$

# Newtonian vs Non-newtonian Fluids

> A Newtonian fluid is a fluid in which the viscous stresses arising from its flow, at every point, are linearly correlated to the local strain rate â€” the rate of change of its deformation over time.

Newtonian fluids have **constant** $\mu$ at a given temperature, while non-newtonian fluids have $\mu$ **varying** with rate of shear strain

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6e/Dilatant-pseudoplastic.svg/220px-Dilatant-pseudoplastic.svg.png)

Examples of newtonian fluids include

-   Water
-   Oil
-   Air

Examples of non-newtonian fluids include

-   Toothpaste
-   Latex paint
-   Water and corn starch mixture

## Kinematic Viscosity

> Kinematic viscosity is the dynamic viscosity of a fluid per unit density.

Kinematic viscosity is defined as

$$
\nu = \frac{\mu}{\rho}
$$

where $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\rho$ is the density of the fluid.

Units of $\nu$ = $m^2s^{-1}$

## Difference between dynamic and kinematic viscosity

Dynamic viscosity is the measurement of the fluid's internal resistance to flow, while kinematic viscosity is the ratio of dynamic viscosity to its density.

Fluids with similar dynamic viscosities may have different kinematic viscosities depending on density and vice versa.

# Application for Newton's Law of Viscosity

$$
\tau = \mu \frac{du}{dy} \\
\frac{F}{A} = \mu \frac{du}{dy}
$$

From the equation above, we can find the viscosity $\mu$ of the fluid, or the shear force $F$ acting on the fluid

# Compressibility of Fluids

-   When pressure increases from $p$ to $p + dp$, volume reduces from $V$ to $V + dV$ ($dV$ is negative)
-   To describe compressibility, we use **bulk modulus**, which is defined as

$$
E_v = -\frac{dp}{dV / V} = -V \frac{dp}{dV}
$$

> Bulk modulus is the relative change in volume of a body produced by a unit compressive force acting uniformly over its surface

$E_v$ is the bulk modulus of the fluid, $dp$ is change in pressure, $dV$ is the change in volume, $V$ is the overall volume. Compressibility is defined as $C = \frac{1}{E_v}$

Now, looking at density, we know that $\rho = \frac{M}{V}$. By differentiating density with respect to volume,

$$
\begin{aligned}
d \rho &= - \frac{M}{V^2} dV \\
&=  - \rho \frac{dV}{V} \\
\frac{d \rho}{\rho} &= - \frac{dV}{V}
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence we can conclude, that

$$
E_v = -\frac{dp}{dV / V} = \frac{dp}{d\rho / \rho}
$$

# Surface Tension

> Surface tension is the tension of the surface film of a liquid caused by the attraction of the particles in the surface layer by the bulk of the liquid, which tends to minimize surface area.

The surface tension is the force per unit length of the membrane

$$
\sigma = \frac{F}{L}
$$

## Surface Tension for half-drop of rain

Consider a half-drop of rain

![](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/images/hemisphere001.gif)

We shall look at the surface tension on the flat half of the hemisphere. Imagine a raindrop on a flat surface.

The hemisphere has radius $r$. Let the difference in pressure between the inside and outside of the raindrop be $\Delta p$.

For the raindrop to not break, the surface of the raindrop must exert and equal and opposite force to the pressure difference.

The force exerted due to a difference in pressure is:

$$
F = \text{Pressure difference} * \text{Area} = (\Delta p) (\pi r^2)
$$

The force exerting back is now given by

$$
F = \text{Force per unit Length} * \text{Length} = \text{Surface Tension} * \text{Length of surface} = \sigma (2 \pi r)
$$

Note that the length of the membrane is the circumference of the hemisphere. Because the water has "tension" with the sides of the circle.

Hence,

$$
\Delta p \pi r^2 = \sigma 2 \pi r \\
\sigma = \frac{1}{2} \Delta p r
$$

## Surface Tension of a Spherical Bubble

Using surface tension, we know that the force by surface tension is given as

$$
F_{ST} = \sigma L = \sigma (2) (2 \pi r)
$$

where $\sigma$ is the surface tension of the bubble, and $L$ is the length in which the force acts upon. It is twice the circumference of the bubble because both the top and bottom hemispheres exert a force on the bubble's cross sectional area.

Also, since $P = \frac{F}{A}$,

$$
F = PA = \Delta p A
$$

wher $\Delta p$ is the difference in pressure inside and outside the bubble, while $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the bubble

Equating both together,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma (2) (2 \pi r) &= \Delta p A \\
\sigma &= \frac{\Delta p r}{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Surface Tension due to Water Rising In a Small Open Glass Test Tube

Attraction between the tube wall and water molecules is stronger than attraction between water molecules, hence the water is pulled **up** the walls. Such liquids are called **wetting liquids**.

![](https://www.concepts-of-physics.com/mechanics/media/capillary-rise.svg)

Consider a glass tube with radius $r$ and the height of water from the bottom of the tube to the bottom of the meniscus be $h$. Let $\theta$ be the angle between the wall of the tube and the tangent to the surface of the meniscus at the point of contact with the wall.

![](https://thefactfactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Capillary-Action-05.png)

The length of the surface tension force is $2 \pi r$. Since the water is contacting the glass surface at an angle $\theta$, the vertical component of the force is $\sigma \cos \theta$. Hence the total force acting directly upwards is

$$
F = \text{Length} * \text{Force per unit length} = (2 \pi r) (\sigma \cos \theta)
$$

The force acting on the surface of the water is given by

$$
F = p A = (\rho g h) (\pi r^2)
$$

Equating the 2 forces together

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 \pi r \sigma \cos \theta &= \rho g h \pi r^2 \\
\cos \theta &= \frac{\rho g h r}{2 \sigma}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: For water in contact with clean glass, $\theta = 0$

## Mercury depresses in a small open glass tube

![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--PmMvR4A014/WZQhCDsRe5I/AAAAAAAAIZU/qAR9jLVi0f4U9YrbT3-ZqqLfTsOFtQA3gCLcBGAs/s1600/what%2Bis%2Bcapillarity%2Bimages2.png)

When mercury is in contact with a glass tube, its level will be depressed.

Such liquids are called **non-wetting liquids**. Non-wetting liquids usually have an angle of contact $> 90^o$. For mercury, $\theta = 130 ^o$

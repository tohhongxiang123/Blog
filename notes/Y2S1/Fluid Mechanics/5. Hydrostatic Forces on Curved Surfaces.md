# Hydrostatic Forces on Curved Surfaces

![](https://www.engineersedge.com/imagefiles/submerged-curved-pressure.gif)

For the hydrostatic forces on a curved surface, we split the force into 2

1. The horizontal force, $F_H$ is given by the hydrostatic force on its **projected area on the vertical plane**
2. The vertical force, $F_V$ is given by the hydrostatic force due to the weight of fluid (free body) confined by the solid boundary, the vertical imaginary plane, and the free surface

The resultant fluid force,

$$
F_R = \sqrt{F_H^2 + F_V^2}
$$

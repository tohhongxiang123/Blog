# Turbulent Pipe Flows

Turbulent flow is characterised by chaotic nature. In describing turbulent flow, we use a time-averaged mean value of the velocity, and the fluctuating component superimposed on top

# Dimensional Analysis of Pipe Flow

The pressure drop caused by the wall shear, $\tau_w$, for steady incompressible turbulent flow along a horizontal pipe of diameter $D$, is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta p &= \phi_1 ( V, D, L, \epsilon, \rho, \mu ) \\
\frac{\Delta p}{(\rho V^2) / 2} &= \phi_2 \left( \frac{\rho V D}{\mu}, \frac{L}{D}, \frac{\epsilon}{D} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

In the equations above,

- $V$ is the velocity of the fluid flow
- $D$ is the diameter of the pipe
- $L$ is the length of the pipe
- $\epsilon$ is the surface roughness
- $\rho$ is the density of the fluid
- $\mu$ is the viscosity of the fluid

Now, if we assume that the pressure drop is proportional to $L/D$, then

$$
\frac{\Delta p}{(\rho V^2) / 2} = \left( \frac{L}{D} \right) \phi_3 \left( \frac{\rho V D}{\mu}, \frac{\epsilon}{D} \right)
$$

Let us define a friction factor, $f = \phi_4 \left( \frac{\rho V D}{\mu}, \frac{\epsilon}{D} \right) = \phi_4 \left( Re, \frac{\epsilon}{D} \right)$

Then, we can get an expression for $\Delta p$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\Delta p}{(\rho V^2) / 2} = \frac{fL}{D} \\
\frac{\Delta p}{\rho g} = \frac{fLV^2}{2Dg}
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence pressure head loss, $h_f = \frac{\Delta p}{\rho g} = \frac{fLV^2}{2Dg}$. This is the **Darcy-Weisbach Equation**

# Darcy-Weisbach Equation

Friction head loss in a fully developed turbulent flow along a straight horizontal circular pipe of length $L$, diameter $D$ and mean velocity $V$ is given by

$$
h_f = f \frac{L}{D} \frac{V^2}{2g}
$$

where $f$ = Darcy-Weisbach friction factor

The variation between $f$ and $\frac{\epsilon}{D}$ as the third parameter has 4 different characteristics, shown in the moody diagram

1. $Re < 2100$, in laminar flow, $f$ is a function of $Re$ only, and is independent of $\frac{\epsilon}{D}$. $f$ is given by $f = \frac{64}{Re}$
2. $2100 < Re < 4000$, the fluid is flowing in the transition range, $f$ is uncertain as flow may be either turbulent or laminar
3. $Re > 4000$ but not fully turbulent flow, $f$ depends on both $Re$ and $\frac{\epsilon}{D}$
4. $Re$ is very large, and flow is fully turbulent. $f$ depends only on $\frac{\epsilon}{D}$, and is independent of $Re$

# Friction Factor Formulas and Typical $\epsilon$ values

| Pipe            | Equivalent roughness, $\epsilon$ in milimeters |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Riveted steel   | 0.9-9.0                                        |
| Concrete        | 0.3-3.0                                        |
| Wood stave      | 0.18-0.9                                       |
| Cast Iron       | 0.26                                           |
| Galvanized Iron | 0.15                                           |
| Plastic/Glass   | 0 (Smooth)                                     |

There are multiple formulas to get the value of $f$. Note that to get $f$, we would use the Moody Diagram rather than explicitly calculating the factor

- Colebrook (1939) formula (valid for all $Re$)
  $$
      \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}} = -2.0 \log \left[ \frac{2.51}{Re \sqrt{f}} + \frac{\epsilon / D}{3.7} \right]
  $$
- Blasius (1908) formula for smooth pipes ($\epsilon / D = 0$)
  $$
      f = \frac{0.316}{Re^{0.25}}
  $$
  - Valid for $3000 < Re < 100,000$
- Colebrook's formula requires iteration on $f$ to find the value. An explicit formula by Haaland (1983) which is within 2% of Colebrook's formula is
  $$
      \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}} = -1.8 \log \left[ \frac{6.9}{Re} + \left( \frac{\epsilon / D}{3.7} \right)^{1.11} \right]
  $$

## Non-circular Pipes

If the pipe is non-circular, we first calculate the Reynold's number by

$$
Re = \frac{\rho V D_H}{\mu}
$$

where the characteristic length, $D_H = \frac{4A}{P}$, where $A$ is the cross sectional area of the non-circular pipe and $P$ is the wetted perimeter

Then, the head loss due to friction is

$$
h_f = f \frac{L}{D_H} \frac{V^2}{2g}
$$

# Minor Losses in Pipes

- Most pipe systems contain long straight pipe sections and other components such as valves, bends, junctions etc
- Friction head losses for straight sections can be computed with the Darcy-Weisbach equation
- Head losses due to other components are known as minor losses
- Minor losses, $h_l$, are commonly specified in terms of a loss coefficient, $K_L$, which is defined as

  $$
  h_l = K_L \frac{V^2}{2g}
  $$

- $K_L$ is determined experimentally

## Entrance losses (Pipe into tank)

![Minor losses due to entrance shape of pipe](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9781856178280000044-gr3.jpg)

## Exit losses (Pipe into tank)

$K_L = 0$ for all entrance shapes, because all the kinetic energy is completely dissipated after the flow exits and mixes with the large volume in the tank

## Sudden Contraction Loss

![Contraction loss graph](https://sbainvent.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sudden-contraction-graph.jpg)

- When $A_2 / A_1 = 0$ (sharp edge), $K_L = 0.5$
- When $A_2 / A_1 = 1$, no area change, hence $K_L = 1$

## Sudden Expansion Losses

![Sudden expansion](https://www.tutorhelpdesk.com/UserFiles/loss%20of%20energy%20due%20to%20sudden%20expansion.JPG)

From continuity and momentum analysis, we can see that

$$
K_L = (1 - \frac{A_1}{A_2})^2
$$

Note that $A_1/A_2 = 0$ is equivalent to the pipe exit where $K_L = 1$

## Pipe Bends

## Pipes in Series and Parallel

For pipes in series,

![Pipes in series](http://abe-research.illinois.edu/faculty/dickc/Engineering/pipeseriesa_files/image002.jpg)

- $Q_1 = Q_2= Q_3$
- $h_f = h_{f_1} + h_{f_2} + h_{f_3}$

For pipes in parallel

![Pipes in parallel](http://abe-research.illinois.edu/faculty/dickc/Engineering/pipeseriesa_files/image004.jpg)

- $Q = Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3$
- $h_{f_1} = h_{f_2} = h_{f_3}$

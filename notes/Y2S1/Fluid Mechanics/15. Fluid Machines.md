# Fluid Machines

Fluid machines add or extract energy from fluid flow

-   Pumps add energy to fluids
-   Turbines extract energy from fluids

Fluid machines can be

-   Positive displacement machines
    -   Forces fluids in/out of a chamber by changing the volume of the chamber
-   Turbomachine
    -   Has a rotor around an axis which adds/removes energy from fluid

# Pump Performance

The head rise, $h_a$ gained by a fluid flowing through a pump can be determined by bernoulli's equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
h_a + \frac{p_1}{\rho g} + \frac{v_1^2}{2g} + z_1 &= \frac{p_2}{\rho g} + \frac{v_2^2}{2g} + z_2 \\
h_a &= \frac{p_2 - p_1}{\rho g} + \frac{v_2^2 - v_1^2}{2g} + z_2 - z_1
\end{aligned}
$$

We know that the above equation gives the total energy head. To get the above in terms of energy per unit volume, we multiply $h_a$ by $\rho g$

$$
E/V = \rho g h_a = p_2 - p_1 + \frac{\rho}{2}(v_2^2 - v_1^2) + \rho g (z_2 - z_1)
$$

Multiplying the above equation by $Q$ gives the power gained by the fluid. The power gained by a fluid is given by the equation

$$
P = \rho g Q h_a
$$

The efficiency of a pump is given by

$$
\eta = \frac{P_{fluid}}{W_{shaft}}
$$

Where $P_{fluid}$ is power gained by the fluid, and $W_{shaft}$ is the power supplied to the pump. Overall efficiency of the pump is affected by

-   Hydraulic losses
-   Mechanical losses (bearings, seals)
-   Volumetric losses (leakages)

# Pump Performance Characteristics

-   The efficiency of a pump reaches a maximum value at a particular point
-   The points corresponding to the maximum efficiency are known as the best efficiency point (BEP)
-   Pumps are selected to operate near BEP

# Pump Selection

Consider a tank $A$ at height $z_1$. Water flows from $A$ through a pump, into a second tank $B$ at height $z_2$. The losses by the fluid flowing through the pipe is $\sum h_L$ By using bernoulli's equation between points $1$ and $2$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
h_a + \frac{p_1}{\rho g} + \frac{v_1^2}{2g} + z_1 &= \frac{p_2}{\rho g} + \frac{v_2^2}{2g} + z_2 + \sum h_L \\
h_a &= (z_2 - z_1) + \sum h_L \\
&= (z_2 - z_1) + \frac{fLV^2}{2gD} \\
&= (z_2 - z_1) + \frac{8fL}{g\pi^2 D^5} Q^2
\end{aligned}
$$

This equation is known as the System Characteristic Curve (SCC)

When the SCC and PPC (Pump performance curve) are plotted on the same graph, the intersection point represents the operating (duty) point. Ideally the operating point should be near the BEP. However, as pipeline ages, friction losses could increase, resulting in a shift in the duty point away from the BEP, resulting in reduced pumping rate and efficiency

# Dimensionless Parameters and Similarity Law

The main dependent variables for pumps are $h_a$ (head rise across pump $[L]$), $W_{shaft}$ (shaft power, $[ML^2/T^3]), and $\eta$ (efficiency, dimensionless). Each dependent variable can be expressed in terms of the following independent variables

$$
h_a, W_{shaft}, \eta = f(D, L_i, \epsilon, Q, \omega, \mu, \rho, g)
$$

-   $D$ is the diameter of the pipe $[L]$
-   $L_i$ is a length scale $[L]$
-   $\epsilon$ is the roughness of the pipe $[L]$
-   $Q$ is the flow rate of the pipe $[L^3T^{-1}]$
-   $\omega$ is the rotational speed of the pump $[T^{-1}]$
-   $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid $[ML^{-1}T^{-1}]$
-   $\rho$ is the density of the fluid $[ML^{-3}]$
-   $g$ is acceleration due to gravity $[MT^{-2}]$

Using dimensional analysis with repeating variables $\rho, D, \omega$, we can find the following

1. Head rise coefficient, $C_H$

    $$
    C_H = \frac{g h_a}{\omega^2 D^2} = \phi_1 \left( \frac{L_i}{D}, \frac{\epsilon}{D}, \frac{Q}{\omega D^3}, \frac{\rho \omega D^2}{\mu} \right)
    $$

2. Power coefficient, $C_P$

    $$
    C_P = \frac{W_{shaft}}{\rho \omega^3 D^5} = \phi_2 \left( \frac{L_i}{D}, \frac{\epsilon}{D}, \frac{Q}{\omega D^3}, \frac{\rho \omega D^2}{\mu} \right)
    $$

3. Efficiency, $\eta$

    $$
    \eta = \frac{\rho g Q h_a}{W_{shaft}} = \phi_3 \left( \frac{L_i}{D}, \frac{\epsilon}{D}, \frac{Q}{\omega D^3}, \frac{\rho \omega D^2}{\mu} \right)
    $$

4. Flow coefficient, $C_Q$

    $$
    C_Q = \frac{Q}{\omega D^3}
    $$

## Similarity Laws for Pumps

For the same pump, or geometrically similar pumps, at high Reynolds number, and assuming that $\epsilon/D$ is not significant, the equations are simplified into

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{g h_a}{\omega^2 D^2} &= \phi_1 \left( \frac{Q}{\omega D^3} \right) \\
\frac{W_{shaft}}{\rho \omega^3 D^5} &= \phi_2 \left( \frac{Q}{\omega D^3} \right) \\
\eta = \frac{\rho g Q h_a}{W_{shaft}} &= \phi_3 \left( \frac{Q}{\omega D^3} \right) \\
C_Q &= \frac{Q}{\omega D^3}
\end{aligned}
$$

For geometric similar pumps operating at the same flow coefficient

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left( \frac{Q}{\omega D^3} \right)_1 &= \left( \frac{Q}{\omega D^3} \right)_2 \\
\left( \frac{g h_a}{\omega^2 D^2} \right)_1 &= \left( \frac{g h_a}{\omega^2 D^2} \right)_2 \\
\left( \frac{W_{shaft}}{\rho \omega^3 D^5} \right)_1 &= \left( \frac{W_{shaft}}{\rho \omega^3 D^5} \right)_2 \\
\eta_1 &= \eta_2
\end{aligned}
$$

## Special Pump Scaling Laws

For the same sized pump $D_1 = D_2$, operating at different speeds but the same flow coefficient

$$
\frac{Q_1}{Q_2} = \frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2}; \frac{h_{a_1}}{h_{a_2}} = \frac{\omega_1^2}{\omega_2^2}; \frac{W_{shaft_1}}{W_{shaft_2}} = \frac{\omega_1^3}{\omega_2^3}
$$

For geometrically similar family pumps operating at the same speed $\omega_1 = \omega_2$, and same flow coefficient,

$$
\frac{Q_1}{Q_2} = \frac{D^3_1}{D^3_2}; \frac{h_{a_1}}{h_{a_2}} = \frac{D_1^2}{D_2^2}; \frac{W_{shaft_1}}{W_{shaft_2}} = \frac{D_1^5}{D_2^5}
$$

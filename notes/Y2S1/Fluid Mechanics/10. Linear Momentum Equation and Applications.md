# Linear Momentum Equation and Applications

-   With the law of mass conservation, we can calculate how much of a fluid enters and leaves a control volume
-   We will now derive Newton's second law of motion
-   We will study hydrodynamic forces caused by changes in velocity magnitude/direction

# Difference between Hydrostatic and Hydrodynamic Forces

Imagine a gate with water on one side. If the gate is closed, the force on the gate is due to static pressure (hydrostatic pressure)

$$
F_s = \rho g h_c A
$$

When a gate is open, water flows out past the gate. The force on the gate is due to both

1. Hydrostatic pressure
2. Momentum change

# Linear Momentum Equation for a System

Hydrodynamic force is governed by Newton's second law of motion. Applying the law to a fixed mass, for an object of mass $m$ experiencing a force $F$,

$$
F = ma = m \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d(mV)}{dt} = \frac{dp}{dt}
$$

$a$ is the acceleration of the object, $v$ is the velocity of the object, and $p$ is the momentum of the object, where $p = mv$

Force is the rate of change of momentum

# Momentum Flow Rate

Consider uniform velocity $V$, normal to area $A$. The flow passing through $A$ can be described using

-   Volume flow rate: $Q = AV$
-   Mass flow rate: $\dot{m} = \frac{dm}{dt} = \rho \frac{dV}{dt} = \rho Q$
    -   Note that $\rho Q$ = mass per unit volume \* volume flow rate
-   Momentum flow rate: $\frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{d(mV)}{dt} = V \rho Q$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dp}{dt} &= \frac{d(mV)}{dt} \\
&= V\frac{dm}{dt} + m\frac{dV}{dt} \\
&= V \frac{dm}{dt} &(\frac{dV}{dt} = 0 \text{ for steady flow}) \\
&= V \rho Q
\end{aligned}
$$

# Linear Momentum Equation for a Control Volume

In a control volume, given net force $F$ acting on a fluid in the control volume in the x-direction

Momentum changes per unit time:

-   Momentum gain due to inflow: $p_{in} = \rho Q_{in} V_{in}$
-   Momentum gain due to force: $F$
-   Momentum loss due to outflow: $p_{out} = \rho Q_{out} V_{out}$

Hence,

$$
F + \rho Q_{in} V_{in} = \rho Q_{out} V_{out} \\
F = \rho Q_{out} V_{out} - \rho Q_{in} V_{in}
$$

If a control volume has multiple inflows and outflows, then

$$
\sum F_x = \sum (\rho Q V_x)_{out} - \sum (\rho Q V_x)_{in}
$$

The net force on a fixed control volume is the sum of outlet momentum flow rates - sum of internal momentum flow rates

# Net Force Acting on Fluid in CV

-   Net force acting on a fluid in a CV = sum of forces acting on the fluid's surface + weight of fluid in CV
-   On each surface, the force can be resolved into 2 perpendicular components, pressure (perpendicular) and shear (tangential)
-   For ideal frictionless fluid, shear force = 0

# Force Acting on Sluice Gate

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/joUZr.gif)

Consider a fluid with density $\rho$ flowing from point $1$ to $2$. At point $1$, it has a height $h_1$, and it flows out below the sluice gate at a height $h_2$.

Find the force acting on the sluice gate

Firstly, by continuity,

$$
\begin{aligned}
A_1 v_1 &= A_2 v_2 \\
v_1 &= \frac{A_2}{A_1} v_2 \\
&= \frac{h_2}{h_1} v_2
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we have a relation between $v_1$ and $v_2$. By choosing points $1$ and $2$ to be on the surface of the fluid on the left and right of the sluice gate respectively, by bernoulli's equation,

$$
\frac{p_1}{\rho g} + \frac{v_1^2}{2g} + z_1 = \frac{p_2}{\rho g} + \frac{v_2^2}{2g} + z_2 \\
\frac{v_1^2}{2g} + h_1 = \frac{v_2^2}{2g} + h_2
$$

Now solving both equations simultaneously,

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_2 &= \sqrt{\frac{2 g h_1^2 (h_2 - h_1)}{h_2^2 - h_1^2}} \\
v_1 &= \sqrt{\frac{2 g h_2^2 (h_2 - h_1)}{h_2^2 - h_1^2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we find the forces due to the water moving through the sluice gate:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_1 &= \rho g h_c A \\
&= \rho g \frac{h_1^2}{2} d \\
F_2 &= \rho g \frac{h_2^2}{2} d
\end{aligned}
$$

where $d$ is the depth of the sluice gate. Now, by conservation of momentum,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum F &= M_{out} - M_{in} \\
F_1 - F_2 - F_d &= \rho Q v_2 - \rho Q v_1 \\
&= \rho A_2 v_2^2 - \rho A_1 v_1^2 \\
&= \rho d (h_2 v_2^2 - h_1 v_1^2) \\
\rho g \frac{h_1^2}{2} d - \rho g \frac{h_2^2}{2} d - F_d &= \rho d (h_2 v_2^2 - h_1 v_1^2) \\
&= \rho d \left( \frac{2 g h_1^2 h_2 (h_2 - h_1)}{h_2^2 - h_1^2} - \frac{2 g h_2^2 h_1 (h_2 - h_1)}{h_2^2 - h_1^2} \right) \\
&= \frac{2g \rho d (h_2 - h_1)}{h_2^2 - h_1^2} (h_1^2 h_2 - h_2^2 h_1) \\
&= \frac{2g \rho d (h_1^2 h_2 - h_2^2 h_1)}{h_1 + h_2} \\
F_d &= \rho g \frac{h_1^2}{2} d - \rho g \frac{h_2^2}{2} d - \frac{2g \rho d (h_1^2 h_2 - h_2^2 h_1)}{h_1 + h_2} \\
&= \rho g d \left[ \frac{h_1^2}{2} - \frac{h_2^2}{2} - \frac{2(h_1^2 h_2 - h_2^2 h_1)}{h_1 + h_2} \right] \\
&= \rho g d \left[ \frac{(h_1 - h_2)^3}{2(h_1 + h_2)} \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

where $M$ is the momentum flow rate of the fluid

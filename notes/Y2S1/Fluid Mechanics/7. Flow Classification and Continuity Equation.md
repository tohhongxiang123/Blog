# Flow Classification and Continuity Equation

# Steady Flow

A steady flow is a flow in which the velocity of the flow does not change with time

$$
\frac{dv}{dt} = 0
$$

In reality, almost all flows are unsteady

# Laminar and Turbulent Flows

Laminar flow is characterised by fluid flowing smoothly in layers, while turbulent flows is characterised by fluid flowing chaotically

# Internal Flow vs External Flow

Internal flow is flow confined by solid boundaries - such as inside pipes

External flow is flow over an object 

# Streamline

- A line that is everywhere tangential to flow velocity
- For steady flow, the streamlines are fixed in space

# Control Volume

- A volume in space in which fluid flows through
- Usually fixed in space, independent of fluid
- Eulerian approach
    - Describing flows at fixed points in space
    - Defining fluid properties as functions of space and time

# Continuity Equation

- Derived from mass conservation
- For a fixed, non-deforming control volume (CV), mass conservation requires that, within a small time period $\Delta t$,

$$
\text{Increase of mass inside CV} = \text{Net mass inflow through control surface}
$$

- If the mass in the CV does not change,

$$
\text{Net mass inflow through control surface} = 0
$$

# Integral Form of Continuity Equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 &= \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_{CV} \rho dV + \int_{CS} \rho V_n dA \\ 
\end{aligned}
$$

This equation is saying that

Mass conserved = Rate of change of mass within control volume + Net inflow of mass through control surface

For steady flow, $\int_{CS} \rho V_n dA = 0$ since there is 0 net mass inflow/outflow. Hence,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{CS} \rho V_n dA &= \sum \dot m_{in} - \sum \dot m_{out} \\ 
&= 0 \\
\therefore \sum \dot m_{in} &= \sum \dot m_{out}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Procedure

1. Choose 2 sections, (1) and (2)
2. At time $t_1$, inflow velocity = $V_1$, outflow velocity = $V_2$
3. Within a small time interval $\Delta t$, mass inflow = $\rho_1 V_1 A_1$, mass outflow = $\rho_2 V_2 A_2$
4. For steady flows, mass inflow = mass outflow

$$
\rho_1 V_1 A_1 = \rho_2 V_2 A_2
$$

5. If $\rho_1 = \rho_2$, then 

$$
V_1 A_1 = V_2 A_2 = Q
$$

This equation states that volume flow rate $Q$ is constant

# TLDR

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum Q_{in} &= \sum Q_{out} \\
\sum A_{in} V_{in} &= \sum A_{out} V_{out}
\end{aligned}
$$

Assumptions:

- $\rho$ is constant
- Flow is steady
- $V$ is uniform across $A$
- $V$ is perpendicular across $A$

# Hydrostatic Forces on a Plane Surface

For a small plane $P$ with area $dA$, a height $h$ from the surface, the pressure on the plane is $p = \rho g h$, hence the force on the small plane is $dF = \rho g h dA$

# Hydrostatic Force on a Plane Surface

The force on dA,

$$
dF = \rho g h dA = \rho g y \sin \theta dA
$$

To find the resultant force on the entire plane, we must sum up all the dA. Hence we integrate over the area

$$
\begin{aligned}
F &= \int dF \\
&= \int^{A} \rho g y \sin \theta dA \\
&= \rho g \sin \theta \int^{A} y dA \\
&= \rho g \sin \theta A y_c \\
&= \rho g A h_c
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: To find the centroid of any plane, we take the average of the integral over the area

$$
y_c = \frac{\int^{A} y dA}{A} \\
\therefore \int^{A} y dA = A y_c
$$

# Line of Action of Hydrostatic Force

![](https://www.ecourses.ou.edu/ebook/fluids/ch02/sec023/media/d02321.gif)

Where does the line of action of the hydrostatic force act on a plane?

We can do that by taking moments about $O$, the intersection of the plane and the fluid surface.

First we find the moment due to the small force $dF$

$$
\begin{aligned}
dM &= dFc \\
&= dF y \\
&= (\rho g y \sin \theta dA) y \\
&= \rho g y^2 \sin \theta dA
\end{aligned}
$$

Now we can find the overall moment by integrating all the individual small moments $dM$ along the area

$$
\begin{aligned}
M = F y_R &= \int^{A} dM \\
&= \int^{A} \rho g y^2 \sin \theta dA \\
&= \rho g \sin \theta \int^{A} y^2 dA \\ \\

\rho g \sin \theta A y_c y_R &= \rho g \sin \theta \int^{A} y^2 dA \\
y_R &= \frac{\int^{A} y^2 dA}{A y_c} \\
&= \frac{I_o}{A y_c}
\end{aligned}
$$

$F y_R$ is the resultant moment about $O$, and $\int^{A} y^2 dA = I_o$ is the second moment of area, or moment of inertia, about $O$

Check the [list of second moment of areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_second_moments_of_area) for common shapes.

Because $y$ is measured from the liquid surface, it is hard to determine the value of $\int^{A} y^2 dA$. Hence we can use [parallel axis theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_second_moments_of_area#Parallel_axis_theorem) to figure out:

$$
I_o = I_c + Ay_c^2 \\
\therefore y_R = \frac{I_c + Ay_c^2}{A y_c} \\
\Delta y = y_R - y_c = \frac{I_c}{Ay_c}
$$

$y_R$ is commonly known as the center of pressure.

# Pressure Prism

A pressure prism is a way of visually describing the variation of hydrostatic pressure within a volume of fluid

-   Pressure at the top = 0
-   Pressure at the bottom = $\rho g h$
-   Average pressure = $\frac{\rho g h}{2}$
-   Resultant force, $F_R = P_{average}A = \frac{\rho g A h}{2}$
-   Magnitude of $F_R$ = Volume of pressure prism
-   Line of action of $F_R$ passes through the centroid of the prism

![](https://slideplayer.com/slide/1732756/7/images/12/Pressure+Prism%3A+Submerged+Vertical+Wall.jpg)

To find the magnitude of the resultant force on the wall, we find the volume of the pressure prism

$$
F_R = \text{Volume of pressure prism} \\
= \text{Force caused by rectangle} + \text{Force caused by triangle} \\
= F_1 + F_2 \\
= \gamma h_1 A + \frac{1}{2} \gamma(h_2 - h_1)A
$$

Then to find the location of the resultant force on the wall, we take moments about $A$

$$
F_R y_A = F_1 y_1 + F_2 y_2
$$

Remember that $y_1$ is the centroid of the rectangle, which is in the middle of the rectangle. $y_2$ is the centroid of the triangle, which is $\frac{2}{3}h$ from the top of the triangle.

# Pressure Measurement

-   Pressure can be measured in terms of Gauge or Absolute Pressure, SI units is Pascal (Pa) or N/m^2

-   Absolute Pressure: Measured relative to (above) perfect vacuum
    -   Pressure of perfect vacuum has 0 Pa, absolute
    -   Gauge pressure: Measured relative to local atmospheric pressure
    -   Absolute pressure = gauge pressure + local atmospheric pressure
    -   Gauge pressure is positive if it is higher than atmospheric pressure, and negative if lower than atmospheric pressure
    -   Negative gauge pressure is also known as suction or vacuum pressure (note that vacuum pressure here does not refer to a real vacuum, just that it is below atmospheric pressure)

# Standard atmospheric pressure

Standard atmosphere - an idealised representation of middle-latitutde, year-round mean conditions of the earth's atmosphere

Pressure, $p = 101.33 kPa$

# Mercury barometer for measuring atmospheric pressure

$$
p_atm = \rho_{Hg} g h + p_{vacuum} = \gamma_{Hg} h \\
\approx 760 mm Hg \\
\approx 10 m H_2 O
$$

It consists of a glass tube closed at one end with the open end immersed in a container of mercury

Pressure at A can be determined by using a measurement of $h$ through the relationship:

$$
p_a = \gamma h
$$

$$
p_a = p_1 \\
p_2 = p_1 + \gamma_1 h_1 \\
p_2 = p_3 = \gamma_2 h_2 \\
\therefore p_a = \gamma_2 h_2 - \gamma_1 h_1
$$

Note: If A contains gas, $\gamma_1$ is very small, hence $p_A = p_1 \approx p_2 = p_3 = \gamma_2 h_2$

$$
p_A + \gamma_1 h_1 = \gamma_2 h_2 + \gamma_3 h_3 + p_B \\
p_A - p_B = \gamma_2 h_2 + \gamma_3 h_3 - \gamma_1 h_1

$$
p_A + \gamma_1 h_1 = \gamma_2 l_2 \sin \theta + \gamma_3 h_3 + p_B \\
p_A - p_B = \gamma_2 l_2 \sin \theta + \gamma_3 h_3 - \gamma_1 h_1

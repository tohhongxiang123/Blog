# Similitude and Modelling

# Modelling

- Design of many major engineering projects often requires the use of models
- A model is a representation of a physical system (prototype) to predict the behavior of the prototype in some desired respects
- Models could be mathematical or physical
- Physical models resemble the prototype but generally of different (smaller) size and operate under different conditions of velocity, pressure, etc.
- It is important that the model is designed and tested properly and rigourously, and the results are intepreted correctly

## Theory of Models

For a given prototype $p$,

$$
\Pi_{1p} = \phi(\Pi_{2p}, \Pi_{3p}, ..., \Pi_{np})
$$

A similar relationshiop can be written for the model $m$:

$$
\Pi_{1m} = \phi(\Pi_{2m}, \Pi_{3m}, ..., \Pi_{nm})
$$

If the model is designed such that $\Pi_{2p} = \Pi_{2m}, ..., \Pi_{np} = \Pi_{nm}$ (model design requirements), then we can predict that

$$
\Pi_{1p} = \Pi_{1m}
$$

This is the **prediction equation**.

### Example:

The drag force $F_D$ on a rectangle of width $w$ and height $h$ placed normal to a fluid with viscosity $\mu$, density $\rho$, flowing at velocity $V$ is defined by

$$
F_d = f(w, h, \mu, \rho, V)
$$

From dimensional analysis previously, we have figured out that:

$$
\frac{F_d}{w^2 \rho V^2} = \phi \left( \frac{w}{h}, \frac{\rho V w}{\mu} \right)
$$

Our model design requirements are

$$
\frac{w_m}{h_m} = \frac{w_p}{h_p}, \frac{\rho_m V_m w_m}{\mu_m} = \frac{\rho_p V_p w_p}{\mu_p}
$$

From which, we can deduce that

$$
V_m = \frac{\mu_m}{\mu_p} \frac{\rho_p}{\rho_m} \frac{w_p}{w_m} V_p
$$

Then our prediction equation is:

$$
F_{D_p} = \left( \frac{w_p}{w_m} \right)^2 \left( \frac{\rho_p}{\rho_m} \right) \left( \frac{V_p}{V_m} \right)^2 F_{D_m}
$$

# Similitude

Similitude refers to the similarity relationship between a **prototype** (the actual model you want to know) and its **model** (the system you test on)

- Not all practical fluid mechanics and hydraulic problems can be solved by analysis alone
- Solutions to many problems require a combination of analysis and experimental data
- Engineers need to be acquainted with the techniques for design and execution of experiments, and the interpretation of experimental data
- Concept of **similitude** allows the measurements made on one system (such as controlled laboratory experiments) to be correlated to the behavior of other similar systems (such as the prototype)

## Similarity

1. Geometric Similarity (GS)
    - Similarity of all length ratios, i.e. model is a scaled version of prototype
2. Kinematic Similarity (KS)
    - Similarity of ratios of velocity and acceleration between model and prototype through out the flow field
3. Dynamic Similarity (DS)
    - Similarity of all forces such as Reynolds, Froude, Weber numbers etc between model and prototype
4. Complete Similarity
    - Must be GS, KS, DS between model and prototype (Note: DS being satisfied implies that both KS and GS are satisfied as well)

### Example 1

Consider the flow through a pipeline (or closed conduit)

From dimensional analysis, the following general function can be derived

$$
\text{Dependent $\Pi$ terms} = \phi \left( \frac{l_i}{l}, \frac{\epsilon}{l}, \frac{\rho V l}{\mu} \right)
$$

where $l_i$ is some geometric dimension, $l$ is some characteristic length and $\epsilon$ is the surface roughness

For geometric similarity, we need to ensure that

$$
\frac{l_{im}}{l_{ip}} = \frac{\epsilon_m}{\epsilon{p}} = \lambda_l
$$

Note that 
$$
\lambda = \frac{l_m}{l_p}
$$

$\lambda$ is known as the **length scale**

For dynamic similarity, 

$$
\frac{\rho_m V_m l_m}{\mu_m} = \frac{\rho_p V_p l_p}{\mu_p} \implies \frac{V_m}{V_p} = \frac{\mu_m \rho_p l_p}{\mu_p \rho_m l_m}
$$

If we use the same fluid for both the model and the prototype, then $\rho_p = \rho_m$ and $\mu_p = \mu_m$, thereforce

$$
\frac{V_m}{V_p} = \frac{l_p}{l_m} = \frac{1}{\lambda_l}
$$

If the dependent $\Pi$ term on the left hand side is pressure drop:

$$
\Pi_1 = \frac{\Delta p}{\rho V^2}
$$

After ensuring complete similarity, we can then conclude that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\Delta p_m}{\rho_m V_m^2} &= \frac{\Delta p_p}{\rho_p V_p^2} \\
\Delta p_p &= \frac{\rho_p}{\rho_m} \left( \frac{V_p}{V_m} \right)^2 \Delta p_m
\end{aligned}
$$

### Example 2

Consider the flow of a fluid along an immersed body. The following general function can be derived from dimensional analysis

$$
\text{Dependent $\Pi$ terms} = \phi \left( \frac{l_i}{l}, \frac{\epsilon}{l}, \frac{\rho V l}{\mu} \right)
$$

If the dependent $\Pi$ term is the drag coefficient $C_D$:

$$
C_D = \frac{F_D}{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 l^2}
$$

Then dynamic similarity requires 

$$
\frac{F_{D_p}}{\frac{1}{2} \rho_p V_p^2 l_p^2} = \frac{F_{D_m}}{\frac{1}{2} \rho_m V_m^2 l_m^2}
$$

Hence we can conclude that

$$
F_{D_p} = \frac{\rho_p}{\rho_m} \left( \frac{V_p}{V_m} \right)^2 \left( \frac{l_p}{l_m} \right)^2 F_{D_m}
$$

### Example 3: Reynold's Number Similarity Problem

Model tests are performed on flow through a 0.6 m diameter valve carrying water at $1 m^3/s$. Same working fluid (water) is used. The model has a diameter of 0.1m. Determine the required flow rate in the model

We note the variables that we are given:
- $D$, the diameter of the valve
- $Q$, the volumetric flow rate through the valve

We want to ensure that dynamic similarity is satisfied. We have to either satisfy

1. Reynold's number similarity
2. Froude's number similarity

Also note that no free surface was mentioned. Remember the definition of Froude's number - ratio of fluid forces to the fluid's weight. Since there is no free surface, we should not follow Froude's number similarity. We should check for Reynold's number similarity to ensure dynamic similarity is satisfied

$$
\left( \frac{\rho V D}{\mu} \right)_p = \left( \frac{\rho V D}{\mu} \right)_m
$$

Since we are using the same working fluid, $\mu$ and $\rho$ remain constant. We can simplify the above similarity equation into

$$
V_m D_m = V_p D_p
$$

Since $Q = VA$,

$$
\frac{Q_m}{Q_p} = \frac{V_m D_m^2}{V_p D_p^2} = \frac{D_m}{D_p}
$$

Therefore, 

$$
Q_m = \frac{D_m}{D_p} Q_p = (0.1/0.6) * 1 = 0.167 m^3 s^{-1}
$$

### Example 4: Froude Similarity Problem - Flow with a Free Surface

Flows in canals, rivers, spillways and stilling basins are free surface flows. Typically, dimensional analysis gives the following general equation

$$
\text{Dependent $\Pi$ terms} = \phi \left( \frac{l_i}{l}, \frac{\epsilon}{l}, \frac{\rho V l}{\mu}, \frac{V}{\sqrt{gL}}, \frac{\rho V^2 l}{\sigma}  \right)
$$

Note that $\frac{\rho V l}{\mu}$ is Reynold's number, and $\frac{V}{\sqrt{gL}}$ is Froude's number, and $\frac{\rho V^2 l}{\sigma}$ is Weber's number. 

In similitude modelling, we usually want to make Reynold's, Froude's and Weber's number all equal between the prototype and the model. However, it is usually not practical to do so in real life. Hence, we will choose relevant forces to ensure similarities.

**For a free surface, Reynold's and Weber's number are not important**. In most free surface flows, surface tensions and viscous effects are too small, and similarity of Reynold's and Weber's number are not required, especially if then model is big enough. Hence the only ensure similarity for Froude's number.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{V_m}{\sqrt{g_m l_m}} &= \frac{V_p}{\sqrt{g_p l_p}} \\ \\
\frac{V_m}{V_p} &= \sqrt{\frac{l_m}{l_p}} \\
&= \sqrt{\lambda_l}
\end{aligned}
$$

Also recall that Reynold's number similarity

$$
\frac{V_m}{V_p} = \frac{1}{\lambda_l}
$$

Hence, if the same fluid is used, we actually cannot satisfy both Fr and Re simulatneously, due to the difference in the length scale used. However, if different fluid is used, then Fr and Re can both be satisfied together. The kinematic viscosity scale is $\lambda_v^{3/2}$. 

### Example 5

A dam spillway is 20m wide, and discharges peak flood of $125 m^3 s^{-1}$. A 1:15 model is constructed. Determine the model width and flow rate. What operating time in model corresponds to 24 hours in prototype? Assume water is used in the model

Since this spillway is a free-surface flow problem, only Fr similarity is required

From Froude's number similarity,

$$
\frac{V_m}{\sqrt{g_m L_m}} = \frac{V_p}{\sqrt{g_p L_p}} \implies \frac{V_m}{V_p} = \sqrt{\frac{L_m}{L_p}}
$$

Given $\frac{L_m}{L_p} = \frac{1}{15}$, $L_m = 1.33m$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{Q_m}{Q_p} &= \frac{V_m L_m^2}{V_p L_p^2} \\
&= \left( \frac{L_m}{L_p} \right)^{\frac{5}{2}} \\ \\
Q_m &= (1/15)^2.5 \times 125 \\
&= 0.143 m^3 s^{-1}
\end{aligned} 
$$

For time, note that $t = d / v$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{T_m}{T_p} = \frac{L_m / V_m}{L_p / V_p} = \sqrt{\frac{L_m}{L_p}} \\ \\

T_m = (1/15)^{1/2} T_p = 6.2 \text{ hours}
\end{aligned}
$$

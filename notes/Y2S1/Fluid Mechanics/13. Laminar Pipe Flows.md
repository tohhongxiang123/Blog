# Laminar Pipe Flows

In laminar flow, there is only one component of velocity. Laminar flow can be solved mathematically. In turbulent flow, there are random velocity components in all directions.

# Reynolds Number

The most important dimensionless parameter for pipe flow is Reynolds number, $Re = \frac{\rho V D}{\mu}$. $Re$ ranges for different flow types are not precise, typically

- Laminar flow Re < 2100
- Turbulent flow Re > 4000
- Transition flow 2100 < Re < 4000

The critical Reynolds number is the value of Re when turbulence begins (sensitive to initial disurbance), and there is no apparent upper limit of Re when flow becomes turbulent, but definite limit below which flow becomes laminar (about 2000)

# Fully Developed Laminar Flow in Circular Pipes

When a flow is fully developed, it will have the same velocity profile at any cross-section within the pipe. We want an expression for $u(r)$, the velocity of the laminar flow in the pipe which is $r$ away from the centerline, and $Q$, the flow rate through the pipe

Consider a horizontal pipe, with fluid flowing through it. Consider point (1), the fluid element at time $t$, and point (2), the fluid element at time $t + \delta t$

![](https://sbainvent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fluid-element-fbd.jpg)

The pressure at (1) is $p_1$, and the pressure at (2) is $p_2 = p_1 - \Delta p$. The pressure drops from (1) to (2) because of the shear stress acting on the fluid. Shear stress is caused by the viscous effects of the fluid.

The force at (1) is $F = pA = p_1 \pi r^2$, while the force at (2) is $F = (p_1 - \Delta p) \pi r^2$. The overall force due to shear stress acting on the fluid, $F = \tau 2 \pi r L$. By balancing forces:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p_1 \pi r^2 - (p_1 - \Delta p) \pi r^2 - 2 \tau \pi r L &= 0 \\
\therefore \frac{\Delta p}{L} &= \frac{2 \tau}{r}
\end{aligned}
$$

From the equation above, we can see that $\tau = Cr$ where $C$ is a constant. This means, when $r = 0$, there will be no shear stress, while at $r = \frac{D}{2}$, the shear stress will be the maximum, $\tau_w$, the wall shear stress.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau &= Cr \\
r = 0, \tau &= 0 \\
r = \frac{D}{2}, \tau = \tau_w, \tau_w &= \frac{CD}{2} \\
C &= \frac{2 \tau_w}{D}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, $C = \frac{2 \tau_w}{D}$, and hence,

$$
\tau = \frac{2 \tau_w}{D} r
$$

Also, from $\frac{\Delta p}{L} = \frac{2 \tau}{r}$, if we substitute the boundary conditions $r = \frac{D}{2}$ and $\tau  = \tau_w$,

$$
\frac{\Delta p}{L} = \frac{4 \tau_w}{D}
$$

Since $\tau = - \mu \frac{du}{dr}$ (velocity decreases as $r$ increases from the centerline),

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\Delta p}{L} &= \frac{2 \tau}{r} \\

\frac{du}{dr} &= - \left( \frac{\Delta p}{2 \mu L} \right) r
\end{aligned}
$$

Integrating both sides with respect to $r$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int \frac{du}{dr} dr = - \int \left( \frac{\Delta p}{2 \mu L} \right) r dr \\
\int du = - \left( \frac{\Delta p}{2 \mu L} \right) \int r dr \\ \\

u = - \left( \frac{\Delta p}{4 \mu L} \right) r^2 + C_1
\end{aligned}
$$

We know when $r = \frac{D}{2}$, $u = 0$ (no-slip condition). Hence, $C_1 = \frac{\Delta p D^2}{16 \mu L}$, where $D = 2R$, and $R$ is the radius of the pipe. Hence,

$$
u(r) = \left( \frac{\Delta p D^2}{16 \mu L} \right) \left[  1 - \left( \frac{r}{R} \right)^2 \right]
$$

At $r = 0, u = V_c$, where $V_c$ is the centerline velocity, substituting into the above equation gives us

$$
V_c = \frac{\Delta p D^2}{16 \mu L}
$$

Hence we can simplify the equation to become

$$
u(r) = V_c \left[  1 - \left( \frac{r}{R} \right)^2 \right]
$$

Also, from previously, since we know that $\frac{\Delta p}{L} = \frac{4 \tau_w}{D}$ and $u(r)$, we can substitute in to find $u(r)$ in terms of $\tau_w$:

$$
u(r) = \left( \frac{\tau_w D}{4 \mu} \right) \left[  1 - \left( \frac{r}{R} \right)^2 \right]
$$

## Flow Rate of Laminar Flow in Circular Pipes

To calculate $Q$, we consider a small element, $dA$ with $dQ$ flowing through it. The velocity of this small element is $u(r)$, hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
dQ &= u(r)  dA \\
Q &= \int u(r) dA \\
&= \int_{0}^{R} V_c \left( 1 - \frac{r^2}{R^2} \right) 2 \pi r dr \\
&= \frac{\pi R^2}{2} V_c
\end{aligned}
$$

By continuity equation, we get

$$
Q = VA = V \pi R^2
$$

where $V$ is the mean velocity in the pipe. We can find the average velocity by equating

$$
\begin{aligned}
V \pi R^2 &= \frac{\pi R^2}{2} V_c \\
V &= \frac{V_c}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

If we substitute the mean velocity $V$ into $V_c = \frac{\Delta p D^2}{16 \mu L}$, we get

$$
V = \frac{\Delta p D^2}{32 \mu L}
$$

And finally, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q &= AV \\
&= \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{\Delta p D^2}{32 \mu L} \\
&= \frac{\pi D^4}{128} \frac{ \Delta p}{\mu L}
\end{aligned}
$$

This is known as **Poiseuille's Equation for Laminar Flow** only.

Also, head loss due to pressure, $h_f$, can be expressed in the equation $\Delta p = \rho g h_f$. We can use Poiseuille's equation to show that

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q &= \frac{\pi D^4}{128} \frac{ \Delta p}{\mu L} \\
VA &= \frac{\pi D^4}{128} \frac{ \rho g h_f}{\mu L} \\
V \frac{\pi D^2}{4} &= \frac{\pi D^4}{128} \frac{ \rho g h_f}{\mu L} \\
h_f &= \frac{32 V \mu L}{D^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

# Summary

- Shear stress $\tau$ is a linear function of $r$
- Velocity profile is a parabolic function of $r$
- Average velocity $V$ is half the maximum centreline velocity $V_c$
- Fully developed laminar pipe flow is also known as Hagen-Poiseuille flow

$$
Q = \frac{\pi D^4}{128} \frac{\Delta p}{\mu L}, \quad h_f = \frac{32 \mu L V}{\rho g D^2}
$$

## Fully Developed Laminar Flow in an Inclined Pipe

![Laminar flow in an inclined pipe](https://sbainvent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fluid-element-fbd-non-horizontal.jpg)

For this, the force balance equation is

$$
\begin{aligned}
(p + \Delta p) \pi r^2 - p \pi r^2 - 2 \tau \pi r l - W \sin \theta = 0 \\
(p + \Delta p) \pi r^2 - p \pi r^2 - 2 \tau \pi r l - \gamma \pi r^2 L \sin \theta = 0 \\
\frac{\Delta p}{L} - \rho g \sin \theta = \frac{2 \tau}{r}
\end{aligned}
$$

Remember that $\gamma = \rho g$. Eventually,

$$
Q = \frac{\pi D^4}{128 \mu L} (\Delta p - \rho g L \sin \theta)
$$

# Introduction to Software Engineering

# What is Software Engineering?

> Software Engineering is the production of maintainable, fault-free software that meets the user's requirements and is delivered on time and within budget

# Activities in Software Engineering

1. **Requirements elicitation** - specify what we are going to make, what it will do and how it will do it
    - Software Requirement Specification
    - Prototype
2. **Design** - What will it look like and how will we make it?
    - Software Design Document
    - Interface Design Document
    - Test Cases
    - Models
3. **Implement** - Construct based on design and requirements specification
    - Source Code
    - System Build
    - Technical Documentation
    - User Manual
    - Test Report
4. **Test** - Ensure it meets requirements and is error free
    - Change Requests
    - Bug Reports
5. **Release it** and **maintain it**

# Software Products are Complex Systems

-   Software products are in continuous change
    -   New releases are required to fix bugs, change/improve functionality, replace legacy hardware or subsystems etc
    -   Failure to design and engineer properly and handle change through development and maintenance of accurate records and documentation results in new errors, instability and degradation of product
    -   Leads to poor customer satisfaction and potentially major accidents/disasters
-   Software products are developed by a team and sometimes multiple teams
    -   No single person can know everything about a large software system
    -   A standard means of modelling and rigorous processes of project management is required to design, implement, test and maintain large complex systems

# Common Models for Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

There are 2 major models for SDLC

1. Formal document driven models, which use documentation to drive the developmental process
2. Iterative and Incremental models,

## Formal Document Driven Models

-   Document driven (Requires rigorous documentation to proceed)
-   Simple to understand, easy to use
-   Little flexibility
-   Difficult and expensive to change scope
-   Good for large and mission-critical projects

Examples of Formal Document Driven Models include

-   [Waterfall Model](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_waterfall_model.htm)
-   [V&V Model](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_v_model.htm)
-   [Spiral Model](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_spiral_model.htm)

## Incremental and Iterative Models

> Incremental Development is when parts of the system are developed at different times or rates, and then integrated as they are completed

-   E.g. building a blogging platform
-   Team 1 will build the user authentication feature
-   Team 2 will build the user profile page
-   Team 3 will build the main user feed
-   Team 4 will build the blog post editor
-   When a team finishes their part of the project, it will be added into the project

```mermaid

    subgraph Team 1
        Analysis --> Design
        Design --> Code
        Code --> Test
        Test --> Increment1(FInalised Feature 1)
    end
    subgraph Team 2
        Analysis2(Analysis) --> Design2(Design)
        Design2 --> Code2(Code)
        Code2 --> Test2(Test)
        Test2 --> Increment2(FInalised Feature 2)
    end
    subgraph Team 3
        Analysis3(Analysis) --> Design3(Design)
        Design3 --> Code3(Code)
        Code3 --> Test3(Test)
        Test3 --> Increment3(FInalised Feature 3)
    end
    Increment1 --> Increment2
    Increment2 --> Increment3
    Increment3 --> FinalProduct(Final Product)

```

> Iterative development is when parts of the system are revisited for revision and improvement

-   Once the user authentication is done, the team can add more features like OAUth signin, "Forgot password" features, linking of accounts etc.
-   Blog post editor may include new features such as custom themes, mentioning other users, hiding posts before a certain date etc.
-   As time goes on, the teams will keep iteratively adding features to the system

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "Initial Planning" as InitialPlanning
    [*] --> InitialPlanning
    InitialPlanning --> Planning
    State Iteration {
        Planning --> Requirements
        Requirements --> Analysis
        Analysis --> Implementation
        Implementation --> Testing
        Testing --> Evaluation
        Evaluation --> Planning
    }

    Testing --> Deployment
    Deployment --> [*]
```

By satisfying the customer through early and continuous delivery of software, we provide early and continuous feedback - allowing for flexibility.

-   For example, the team finishes building the user profile page, but the customer wants a change to the looks of the page. Due to early feedback from customer, it is very easy to change it to fit the customer's requirements.
-   If we had added a lot more features already, and then the customer wanted to change the looks of the page, it would be harder because there are more features to move around

-   [Rapid Prototype Development](https://resources.pcb.cadence.com/blog/2019-what-is-the-rapid-prototype-development-process-and-what-are-the-benefits)

# Which Model to Choose?

-   In practice, a mix of formal document driven and iterative and incremental methods are used
-   Documentation and robust design, implementation and testing is required
-   Flexibility through incremental and iterative design is often needed in some stages of the project

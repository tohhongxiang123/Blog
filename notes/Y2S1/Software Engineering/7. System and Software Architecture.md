# System Architecture

System architecture is considered as a description of the higher level structure of a software system in terms of architectural elements and the interactions between them.

System architecture consists of 2 important things

1. Components
2. Connectors

## Components

A component is a unit of a system that performs some function at runtime

-   E.g. Programs, objects, processes, clients etc.

## Connectors

Connectors refer to the interactions among components

-   E.g. of interactions include: communication, coordination, or cooperation among components
-   E.g. of connectors include: shared variable access, procedure calls, data streams, communication protocols

Implementation of connectors are usually distributed over many system components, often do not correspond to discrete elements of the running system

# Why do we use System Architecture Diagrams

It abstracts away details and simplifies software systems

-   Simplifies a large complex system
-   Hides away details about the components of the system, and shows how they interact with each other

# System Architecture Diagram vs. Software Architecture Diagram vs. Class Diagram

System architecture describes the components of the system. For example, an order entry system that consists of: Web front end, business layer service, and data store etc.

The software architecture diagram shows how a particular component is built. For example, a component of an order entry system is the front-end. The software architecture will show the various layers and interactions of the order entry system - e.g. Model View Controller, web service call outs, how logging will be accompolished etc. It gives an idea about how the system is constructed, and the layeres the system is made up of.

Class diagrams dive deeper into the software architecture diagram. For example, it shows how the logging interface should look like, how the View interacts with the Controller.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Conceptual model that defines the structure, behavior and view of the system | High-level structure of a software and discipline of creating such structures and systems | Low-level details of a specific component of the system |
| Focuses on entire system                                                     | Focuses on a single component of the system                                               | Focuses on the details of a component                   |

## Notes about System Architecture

Architecture is abstract

-   Details about components and connectors are hidden

Architecture is about structure and interactions

-   Focus on the topology of the architecture
-   Components
-   Data and control communication

Architecture is purposeful

-   Demonstrate or analyse the properties of interest
-   Design documentation used as transferable knowledge about software design, evaluation etc.

# Software Architecture

Software architecture refers to the fundamental structure of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems.

One of the hallmarks of software architectural design is the use of the idiomatic patterns of system organisation. An **architectural style** defines a family of systems in terms of a pattern of structural organisation. An architectural style is used to draw a software architectural diagram

-   A vocabulary of components and connectors
-   A set of constraints on how they can be combined
-   One or more semantic models that specify how to determine a system's overall properties from the properties of its parts

## Components in Software Architecture Diagram

A set of component types. For example,

-   Filters in pipe-and-filter styles
-   MVC

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/MVC-Process.svg/1200px-MVC-Process.svg.png)

A set of connectors. For example:

-   Subroutine call, remote procedure calls, data streams, sockets etc.

A topological structure

-   How the components are connected with connectors

A set of semantic constraints that help the designer understand the overall properties of the system. For example:

-   Filters in a pipe-and-filter architecture do not share states with each other
-   One layer can only called the service provided by a lower layer in a layered system (unidirectional data flow)

## Details not included in Software Architecture Diagram

Number of components involved

-   For a pipe-and-filter architecture, it could be 2 filters connected by 1 pipe or 20 filters connected by 19 pipes

Mechanism of interactions

-   In a layered system, the call to the lower layer can be: local procedure calls, remote procedure calls, other communication mechanisms etc., which are not included in the diagram

The function of the system and components

-   One of the components in the diagram may be a database, however the kind of data and the function of the database may differ

# Types of Software Architecture Styles

-   Independent components (System is made up of independent components)

    -   E.g. communcating processes such as client-server interactions
    -   Event systems (Events are triggered when conditions are met, or input is received)

-   Data flow (Data flows into a system, is transformed by a series of modules, and arrive at a final destination, such as an output or data store)
    -   E.g. Batch sequential
    -   Pipe and filter

![Data flow](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/pipers-and-filter.png)

-   Data-centered (Data is designed first, and the application is built around the data)
    -   E.g. Repository, Blackboard

![Data Centered](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/architecture.png)

-   Virtual machine (Can exist as a standalone system, or within a virtual app)

    -   Intepreter
    -   Rule-based system

-   Call and return (Decomposing a program into multiple subprograms)
    -   Remote procedure call architecture
    -   Main program and subroutine

# Analysis of Individual Components Architecture

Advantages

-   Modifiability by decoupling components from each other
-   Concurrent execution by multiple components
-   Scalability
-   Simple integration

Disadvantages

-   Components are independent, communication between components through complicated protocols
-   Correctness is hard to achieve

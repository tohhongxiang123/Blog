# Software Maintenance

Software is hard to maintain if

- Code is unstructured
  - Hard to read, hard to understand code (Spaghetti code)
  - Poor, inconsistent naming, long procedures, strong coupling, weak cohesion, nested IF statements etc
- Developer has insufficient domain knowledge
  - To maintain code, developer needs to have solid understanding of a system from its source code
  - To more spaghetti like the code is, the harder it is to disentangle it
- Code is badly documented
  - No documentation, out of date documentation, or insufficient documentation

Software maintenance is the process of modifying a software system after delivery to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, or adapt to a changed environments

Software maintenance is concerned with

- Correcting errors found after software is delivered
- Adapting the software to changing requirements, changing environments etc

Changes are implemented by modifying existing system components, or adding new components to the system

# Types of Software Maintenance

Fault repairs

- Changing system to fix bugs/vulnerabilities and correct deficiencies in the way it meets its requirements

Environmental adaptation

- Maintenance to adapt software to a different operating environment
- Changing a system so that it operates in a different environment from its initial implementation

Functionality addition/modification

- Modifying a system to satisfy new requirements

# Software Refactoring

- Refactoring is the process of making improvements to a program to slow down degraddation through change. It means modifying (but not adding functionality) a program to:
  - Improve its structure
  - Reduce its complexity
  - Make it easier to understand
- Refactoring does not change software behavior
- Refactoring is a continuous process of improvement throughout the development and evolution process
- Refactoring is intended to avoid structural and code degradation that increases costs and difficulties of maintaining a system

# Program Code Improvements

Code smells: Situations in which the code can be improved

- Duplicate code
- Long methods
- Large classes
- Temporary fields
- Switch (case) statements
- Lazy class
- Data clumping (same group of data reoccurring in several places)
- Tight coupling of 2 classes

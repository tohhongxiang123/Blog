# Introduction to Testing

Testing is required to avoid bugs and flaws in the program

-   A bug is an error/flaw/failure in the program that causes the program to behave unexpectedly

# Can We Test Everything?

Consider that we wanted to test the following function

```
int doSomething(int input) {
    return (input - 1) / 30000;
}
```

The function should do the following:

-   Take an integer input value, add 1 to it, divide by 30000, and return the value

For a 16 bit integer, there are $2^{16}$ possible values. We can still test every possible value, however that is too costly.

We should strategically choose specific values that are likely to cause errors if the function is not correct, or inputs that cover a wide range of vales

-   -1
-   0
-   32767
-   -32767

# Black Box vs White Box Testing

Black box testing is a software testing method in which we do not know the implementation of the function, we only know how the function should behave

-   Choose test cases that are likely to cause errors, or a range of test cases that cover a wide variety of input values

White box testing is a software testing method in which the internal structure of the function under test is known to the tester

-   Usually tries to cover all statements, branches and execution paths

# Basis Path Testing

Basis Path Testing (or Structured testing) is a white box testing method used for designing test cases intended to examine all possible paths of execution in a program

-   Analyse control flow graph
-   Determines cyclomatic complexity of function under test (Refers to the number of linearly independent paths in the function. It is a measure of how complex a function is in regards to the number of possible paths)
-   Obtains linearly independent paths
-   Generates test cases for each path

# Objectives of Testing

-   To show when **software does not work**
-   To reduce the perceived risk of a system not working to an acceptable value
-   To result in low-risk software without much testing efforts

# Types of Testing

1. Black box testing
    - Analyse the requirements and specifications of the function under test
    - E.g. "The income of an applicant should be between 1000 - 2000"
    - Types of black box testing include
        - Equivalence testing and boundary value testing
2. White box testing
    - Analyse implementation, internal paths and structure
    - Types of white box testing include
        - Control flow testing
        - Data flow testing

# Levels of Testing

1. Unit testing - Testing units individually
2. Integration testing - Test units in combination
3. System testing - Test everything (functionality, portability, usability, performance etc.)
4. Acceptance testing - Customer accepts the software and gives us money

# Components of a Test Case

1. Name: The distinct name of the test case
2. Location: Path to test program and its input
3. Input: Input data or commands
4. Oracle: Expected test output
5. Log: Actual output produced by the test

E.g. the test case for a mortgage calculator

| Income | Number of mortgages | Applicant Type | Property Type | Expected result | Test result |
| ------ | ------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 5000   | 2                   | Person         | Cando         | Approval        | Approval    |
| 100    | 1                   | Person         | HDB           | Reject          | Reject      |
| 1501   | 8                   | Person         | Condo         | Reject          | Approval    |

# Order of Test Case Execution

Cascading test cases

1. Create order
2. Update order
3. Delete order
4. Read deleted order

-   Smaller and simple test cases
-   However if one fails, the other test cases may be invalid

Independent test cases

-   Self contained test cases for the above features
-   Parallel test execution
-   However, larger and more complex test cases

# Black Box Testing Process

The tester

1. Analyses requirements or specifications (The hardest step)
    - Equivalence classes and boundary values
2. Chooses valid inputs and invalid inputs (The other hardest step)
3. Determines expected outputs (oracle) for chosen inputs
4. Construct tests with the chosen inputs (e.g. writing JUnit program)

The testing engine (e.g. JUnit)

1. Executes the test
2. Compares actual outputs (log) with the expected outputs (oracle)
3. Determines whether the system under test functions properly

## Pros and Cons

Applicability

-   All levels of system development (Unit, Integration, System and Acceptance testing)

Cons

-   Cannot know how much of the implementation has been tested
-   No notion of testing coverage like in white-box testing

Pros

-   Directs the tester to a small, specific subset of test inputs that can highly likely find the bugs

## Assumptions required for Black-box Testing

1. Verifiable requirements and API specifications exist
    - Make software testable from inception
    - Unambiguous requirements ("Company can hire only people from 18-55 years old", rather than "Company must not hire too young or too old people")
2. Code must be testable
    - Code with a lot of hidden exceptions is very difficult to test under black-box testing
    - E.g. Company can hire only people from 18-55 years old, however if name == "asdf", hire him as CEO

## Motivating Example: Hire or Not?

-   Test a module implementing the following hiring requirements
    -   0-15, 55-99: Do not hire
    -   16-17: Part time
    -   18-54: Full time

We shall look at the 2 types of black box testing

1. Equivalence class testing
2. Boundary value testing

### Equivalence Class Testing - Partitioning Input Values into Equivalence Classes

A set of input values forms an equivalence class if

-   They all are supposed to produce the same output
-   If one value catches a bug, the others probably will too
-   If one value does not catch a bug, the others probably will not either

We want to identify equivalence classes for valid and invalid inputs, to minimise the number of possible inputs we are required to test

#### Equivalence Class Testing Process

The tester

1. Identify valid and invalid equivalence classes that partition the input values
2. Choose at least 1 input value for each equivalence class of each input parameter
3. Determine expected outputs for chosen inputs
4. Construct tests with the chosen inputs

The testing engine

1. Executes the test
2. Compares actual output (logs) with the expected output (oracle)
3. Determines whether the system under test functions correctly

#### Range of Values

-   One equivalence class of valid values (a1 < x < a2)
-   Two equivalence classes of invalid values (x <= a1, x >= a2)

For example, if a system approves an application if the mortgage per applicant is between 0 and 5

-   Valid values: 0 <= x <= 5
-   Invalid values, x < 0, x < 5

If the length of a password must be between 4-8 characters long,

-   Valid values: 4 <= length <= 8
-   Invalid values length <= 3 or length >= 9

For our example,

-   Valid equivalence classes
    -   0 <= age <= 15 (Do not hire)
    -   16 <= age <= 17 (Part time)
    -   18 <= age <= 54 (Full time)
    -   55 <= age <= 99 (Do not hire)
-   Invalid equivalence classes
    -   age <= -1
    -   age >= 100

#### Discrete Values

-   One equivalence class of valid values
-   One equivalence class of invalid values

For example, if a system approves only personal mortgage applications

-   Valid: Person
-   Invalid: Trust, Company, Partnership etc.

The system only approves HDB and Condo mortgage applications

-   Valid: HDB, Condo
-   Invalid: Townhouse, Mobilehome etc.

#### Design Test Cases Using Equivalence Classes

1. Test valid inputs of several parameters
    - Test valid inptus of several parameters at the same time (i.e. per test case)
    - Choose one valid input for each input parameter from an equivalence class
2. Test invalid inputs of several parameters
    - Test only one invalid input from an equivalence class of one input parameter at the same time (i.e. per test case)
    - Chosose valid inputs from an equivalence clasds of all other input parameters

For testing valid inputs:

| Income | Number of mortgage | Applicant Type | Property Type | Expected Result |
| ------ | ------------------ | -------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| $1500  | 0                  | Person         | Condo         | Approval        |
| $2000  | 1                  | Person         | Condo         | Approval        |
| $5000  | 2                  | Person         | Condo         | Approval        |
| $12345 | 3                  | Person         | HDB           | Approval        |
| $76543 | 4                  | Person         | HDB           | Approval        |
| $80000 | 5                  | Person         | HDB           | Approval        |

#### Should We Test Invalid Inputs?

-   Testing by contract
    -   Create test cases only for valid inputs (i.e. input values that satisfy pre-conditions)
-   Defensive testing
    -   Create test cases for both valid and invalid inputs
        -   Do not assume that users will use your code the way it is supposed to be used
        -   Test the module to check whether it behaves as expected for invalid inputs (i.e. does not cause unforeseen errors or abnormal system behavior)

Testers prefer defensive testing as it is more comprehensive. In the end, testers get blamed if the tests do not work

For testing invalid inputs using equivalence classes

-   Each test case should have no more than 1 invalid input
-   This is to check each individual error handling or behavior for each type of invalid input

#### Quick Summary for Equivalence Testing

A key aspect of black box testing is identifying equivalent classes. By identifying equivalence classes, it helps us test effectively with a minimal set of inputs

### Boundary Value Testing (BVT)

-   Boundary Value Testing is only applicable when testing **ranges of values** (cannot be used on discrete values)
    -   Focus on boundaries of the equivalence classes of range of values
    -   Select a minimal set of valid and invalid inputs (values on the boundary, just below the boundary, and just above the boundary) to test
    -   Discrete values do not have boundary values, hence cannot be used for boundary value testing

#### BVT Process

The tester

1. Identify the lower and upper boundaries of equivalence classes of the range of values parameters
2. Choose 3 input values for each boundary
    - One value on the boundary
    - One value just below the boundary
    - One value just above the boundary
    - The just-below and just-above values depends on the value's unit
    - No need to duplicate test cases if the just-below or just-above values fall into other equivalence classes (including the current equivalence class)
3. Determine expected outputs (oracle) for chosen inputs
4. Construct tests with the chosen inputs

Example for determining boundary values:

-   Income range valid equivalence class (1500 <= x <= 80000)
    -   Lower boundary 1500: 1499, 1500, (1501 not required, since it is in the same EC as 1500)
    -   Upper boundary 80000: (79999 not required, since it is in the same EC as 80000), 80000, 80001
    -   Valid boundary values: { 1500, 80000 }
    -   Invalid boundary values: { 1499, 80001 }
-   Number of mortgage valid equivalence class (0 <= x <= 5)
    -   Lower boundary 0: -1, 0, (1 not required, same EC as 0)
    -   Upper boundary 5: (4 not required, same EC as 5), 5, 6
    -   Valid boundary values: { 0, 5 }
    -   Invalid boundary values: { -1, 6 }

For our hiring rules example,

-   Hiring rules (0 <= age <= 15) (Do not hire)
    -   Lower boundary 0: -1, 0, (1 not required)
    -   Upper boundary 15: (14 not required), 15, 16
-   Hiring rules (16 <= age <= 17) (Part time)
    -   Lower boundary 16: (15 not required, was in the previous EC), 16, (17 not required, in the next EC)
    -   Upper boundary 17: (16 not required, in previous EC), 17, (18 not required, in the next EC)
-   Hiring rules (18 <= age <= 54) (Full time)
    -   Lower boundary 18: (17 previous EC), 18, (19 same EC as 18)
    -   Upper boundary 54: (53 same EC as 54), 54, (55 next EC)
-   Hiring rules (55 <= age <= 99) (Do not hire)
    -   Lower boundary 55: (54 previous EC), 55, (56 same EC as 54)
    -   Upper boundary 99: (98 same EC as 99), 99, 100

#### Design Test Cases Using BVs

1. Test valid inputs of several parameters
    - Test valid inputs of several parameters at the same time
    - Choose one valid input from an equivalence class of each input parameter
2. Test invalid inputs of several parameters
    - Test only one invalid input from an equivalence class of one input parameter per test case
    - Choose valid inputs from an equivalence class of all other input parameters

Use the boundary values of the equivalence classes of the range-of-values parameters

-   Values **on-the-boundary** as **valid** inputs
-   **Just below** or **just above** values (if not in other ECs including the current EC) as **invalid** inputs

# White Box Testing

The tester

1. Analyse system under test (SUT) implementation
    - Control flow graph or data flow graph
2. Identify execution paths through the SUT
3. Choose inputs to cause the SUT to execute the selected paths
4. Determines expected outputs (oracle) for the chosen inputs
5. Construct tests with the chosen inputs (e.g. write JUnit program)

The testing engine

1. Executes the test
2. Compares actual outputs (logs) with the expected outputs (oracle)
3. Determines whether the SUT functions properly

## Pros and Cons of White Box Testing

Applicability

-   All levels of system development

Pros

-   Ensures that every path through the SUT has been identified and tested

Cons

-   Testing all execution paths is generally infeasible
    -   E.g. loops, decision points
-   May not detect data and arithmetic bugs
-   Never find paths that are not implemented
    -   E.g. paths in requirements that are missing in implementation are not tested

## Control Flow Graph (CFG)

A directed graph, consisting of nodes and edges where

-   Each node represents a process block or a decision point
-   Each edge represents a control flow decision (i.e. what happens after what)

### Process Block

-   A sequence of statements that execute sequentially
-   Does not contain if/while/for/switch/goto statements
-   Contains any number of sequentially executed stateents in the process block
-   One control flow edge into the process block
-   One control flow edge out of the process block

### If statements

![CFG with decision](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/LampFlowchart.svg/1200px-LampFlowchart.svg.png)

-   Control flow can change at the decision point
-   One control flow edge into decision point
-   Two control flow edges out of the decision point
    -   True and False branch

### Loops

![While loop deicison](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/images/cpp_while_loop.jpg)

-   Similar to if statements, but will loop back to the decision point from the last statement

## Writing Good Tests for White-Box Testing

Level 1 Coverage: 100% statement coverage

-   Create test cases such that all statements are executed at least once under test
    -   Select execution path(s) to cover all the CFG nodes at least once

Level 2 Coverage: 100% Branch Coverage

-   Create tests such that all branches out of the decision points are executed at least once under test
    -   Binary decision points evaluates to `true` and `false` at least once

Level 3 - Basis Path Coverage

-   Create tests such that the minimum number of basis paths are executed at least once under test
-   A basis path is a set of linearly independent paths
    -   Each basis path traverses at least one new control flow edge (at least one new node) that has not been traversed before the path is defined
    -   The basis set is not unique
-   Basis path testing is an effective mechanism to deal with exponential combination of branches

Level 4 Coverage: 100% Path Coverage

-   Create test cases such that all execution paths are executed at least once under test
-   May not be feasible in general
    -   Every decision point doubles the number of path required
    -   Every loop multiplies the paths by the number of iterations

## Basis Path Testing

Basis Path Testing (or structured testing) is a white box testing method used for designing test cases intended to examine all possible paths of execution in a program at least once

1. Analyse CFG
2. Determine cyclomatic complexity value
3. Obtain linearly independent paths
4. Generate test cases for each path

Basis Path Testing guarantees 100% statement and branch coverage

### Cyclomatic Complexity of CFG

-   CC measures how complex your program is in terms of the number of decision points (if, while, for, switch)
-   The more decision points a program has, the higher the CC, the more basis paths you need to test
-   If your program has CC value of 6, then you have to identify 6 basic paths to test

The CC of a CFG is given by

-   CC = |edges| - |nodes| + 2
-   If all decision points are binary (one true + one false branch), CC = |decisionPoints| + 1

### Selecting a Set of Basis Paths

1. Pick a baseline path
    - Reasonably "typical" path of execution
    - Most important path from tester's view
2. For each decision, change the outcome of only that decision
    - Keep the maximum number of other decision points the same
    - If changing the outcome of this decision makes the path infeasible, then change an extra decision's outcome, until the overall path is feasible
    - Sometimes the outcome of the current decision may impact the outcome of a future decision, hence not all paths are actually possible
3. Create a test case for each basis path

### Dealing With Loops

-   When selecting basis path, select the loop only zero and once (no need to consider iteration)
-   When selecting baseline paths, select false branch first at loop decision point (do not enter the loop)
-   When choosing input values to execute the path, the real execution path may execute the loop several times

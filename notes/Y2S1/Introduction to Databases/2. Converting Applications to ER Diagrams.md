# Converting Applications to ER Diagrams

- Identify object involved in application
- Model each type of object as an entity set
- Identify attributes of each entity set
- Identify the relationships among entity sets
- Refine your design
- E.g. NTU Database
  - Objects: Student, Faculties, Professors, Courses, ...
  - Entity sets: Students, Faculties, Professors, Courses, ...
  - Relationships: Course-enrolment, Course-lecturer, ...

# Design Principle 1 - Be Faithful

- Be faithful to specification of the application
- Capture requirements as much as possible

# Design Principle 2 - Avoid Redundancy

- Avoid repetition of information
- E.g. Student-mentor relationship, mentor as an attribute and as a relationship
  - Waste of space
  - Possible inconsistency if we forget to update both

# Design Principle 3 - Keep It Simple

- Always keep designs simple
- If able to simplify, simplify

## Tips: When to Use Subclasses

- Case 1: When subclass has attribute that is absent from superclass
- Case 2: When subclass has its own relationship with some other entity set
  - [Companies] -- employ -- [Parttime] --| isa > -- [Students]

# Design Principle 4 - Don't Overuse Weak Entity Sets

- Weak entity sets might not be "weak"

# ER Diagram - Relational Schema

- Relation schema = name of table + name of attributes
- Database schema = a set of relation schemas

## Entities

- Each entity is converted into a relation that contains all its attributes
- Key of relation = key of entity set

Bars
| ID | Name | Address | License |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ------- |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Many-to-Many Relationships

- Converted into a relation that contains
  - All keys of participating entity set
  - Attributes of relationship (if any)
- Key of relation = key of participating entity sets

Bars -- Sells -- Beers

Relation also contains price the bar sells the beer as

| Bars-ID | Beers-ID | Price |
| ------- | -------- | ----- |
| ...     | ...      | ...   |

## Weak Entity Set -> Relation

- Each weak entity is converted to a relation that contains
  - All of its attributes
  - Key attributes of the supporting entity set
- Supporting relation is ignored

| state-name | city-name | population |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
| ...        | ...       | ...        |

## Subclass -> Relation

- There are 3 different ways
  - The ER approach (One record in multiple relations)
  - The OO approach (One record in one relation, potentially many multiple relation)
  - The NULL approach (One big relation, lots of NULLs)

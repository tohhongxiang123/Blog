# Functional Dependencies

# Data Anomalies

| Name  | NRIC | PhoneNumber | HomeAddress |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Alice | 1234 | 12345678    | Jurong East |
| Alice | 1234 | 98765432    | Jurong East |
| Bob   | 3456 | 45645645    | Pasir Ris   |

-   Primary key of the table is (NRIC, PhoneNumber)
-   There are multiple anomalies in the table
    -   Redundancy - Alice's address is duplicated
    -   Update anomalies - We may accidentally update one of Alice's addresses but leave the other unchanged
    -   Deletion anomalies - If Bob no longer uses a phone, we still cannot remove his number because it is part of the primary key, and primary key attributes cannot be null
    -   Insertion anomalies - If we want to insert a person without a phone number, we cannot, because primary key attributes cannot be null

How do we get rid of those anomalies?

# Normalisation

We split the table up into 2 tables instead

| Name  | NRIC\* | HomeAddress |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| Alice | 1234   | Jurong East |
| Bob   | 3456   | Pasir Ris   |

| NRIC\* | PhoneNumber\* |
| ------ | ------------- |
| 1234   | 12345678      |
| 1234   | 98765432      |
| 3456   | 45645645      |

_The star represents the primary key of the table_

-   Alice's address no longer duplicated
-   Only required to update one entry if the address changes
-   Able to delete phone number fully (By removing the row in the NRIC/PhoneNumber table)
-   We are able to insert an individual without a phone

# Functional Dependencies

In relational database theory, a functional dependency is a constraint between two sets of attributes in a relation from a database. In other words, a functional dependency is a constraint between two keys.

Consider a relation $R$, and sets of attributes $A$ and $B$. $A$ is said to functionally determine $B$ if and only if **each $A$ value in $R$ is associated with precisely 1 $B$ value.**

-   Given an NRIC, can we tell a person's name?
    -   Yes
-   Given a name, can we tell a person's NRIC
    -   No
-   Therefore NRIC determines Name, but not vice versa
-   Functional dependencies: NRIC -> Name, but not Name -> NRIC

> Given attributes $A_1, A_2, ..., A_m$, $B_1, B_2, ..., B_n$, $A_1 A_2 \cdots A_m \rArr B_1 B_2 \cdots B_n$ if and only if there are no 2 records that have the same values $A_1 A_2 \cdots A_m$ but different values on $B_1 B_2 \cdots B_n$

To decide whether a table is good or not, we should examine the correlations of the attributes, i.e. the functional dependencies. But how do we determine that a table is good using FDs?

# Armstrong's Axioms

There are 3 axioms

1. Axiom of Reflexivity
    - If $B \subseteq A$, then $A \rArr B$. These are trivial FDs.
    - A set of attributes -> A subset of the attributes
2. Axiom of Augmentation
    - $A \rArr B \implies AC \rArr BC$ for any $C$
3. Axiom of Transitivity
    - $A \rArr B \land B \rArr C \implies A \rArr C$

# Closure

-   Let $S = { A_1, A_2, ..., A_n }$ be a set of attributes
-   The closure of $S$ is the set of attributes that are reachable from $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$
-   Given A -> B, B -> C, C -> D, D -> E
-   $\{ A \}^+ = \{ A, B, C, D, E \}$
-   $\{ B \}^+ = \{ B, C, D, E \}$
-   $\{ C \}^+ = \{ C, D, E \}$

# Closures and Functional Dependencies

-   To prove that X -> Y, we only need to show that $\{X\}^+$ contains Y

# Keys of a Table

-   A **superkey** is a set of attributes in a table that decide **all other attributes**
-   A **key** is the superkey of the **smallest size** (The minimal superkey)
-   A table can have multiple keys, and each key is a **candidate key**

When a table has multiple keys

-   We choose one of them to be the **primary key**
-   The other keys are **secondary keys**

To find a key in the table, we can use functional dependencies and closure

For a table with attributes $A, B, C$, $A$ is a key if $\{A\}^+$ contains all the attributes of the table

The key of a table is the minimal set of attributes such that all other attributes are within the closure of that set.

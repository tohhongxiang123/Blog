# Third Normal Form (3NF)

3NF is less strict than BCNF, but can always preserve functional dependencies

# First Normal Form

In 1NF

- All attributes have atomic values (single-valued attributes)
- Attribute domain does not change (field type does not change)
  - Attribute domains are rules that describe the legal values of a field type
- Unique name for every attribute/column
- Order of data does not matter

| ID  | Color        |
| --- | ------------ |
| 1   | Red          |
| 2   | Blue, Yellow |

For ID 2, color is divisible into "blue" and "yellow", hence it is not atomic

| ID  | Color  |
| --- | ------ |
| 1   | Red    |
| 2   | Blue   |
| 2   | Yellow |

# Second Normal Form

In 2NF,

- It is in first normal form
- It does not have any **non-prime attribute** (or non-key) that is functionally dependent on any **proper subset of any candidate key** of the relation (No partial dependency)
  - A prime attribute is an attribute that is present in any of the candidate keys (E.g. For R(ABCD), if the key is ABC, then A, B, C are prime attribute, and D is a non-prime attribute)
  - Every non-prime attribute must be functionally dependent on the **whole** of every candidate key

This means that for 2NF, each column in a table that is not a determiner of the contents of another column must itself be **a function of the other columns** in the table (since every non-prime attribute must be functionally depend on the whole of every candidate key). For example, in a table with three columns containing customer ID, product sold, and price of the product when sold, the price would be a function of the customer ID (entitled to a discount) and the specific product.

- R(A, B, C), A -> B, A -> C, B -> C
- Keys of the table: A
- Non-key attributes of the table: B, C
- A -> B means B depends fully on the key
- A -> C means C depends fully on the key
- B -> C, but they are both non-prime attributes, so does not apply to the rule
- Hence R(A, B, C) is in 2NF

Another example:

| studentId | courseId | courseFee |
| --------- | -------- | --------- |
| 1         | C1       | 1000      |
| 2         | C2       | 1500      |
| 1         | C4       | 2000      |
| 4         | C3       | 1000      |
| 4         | C1       | 1000      |
| 2         | C5       | 2000      |

The key for this table is `(studentId, courseId)`. We can see that `courseFee` is a non-prime attribute. However, since `courseId -> courseFee`, this means there exists a non-prime attribute that is functionally dependent on only a **subset** of the key. We can see that if a table violates 2NF, there are redundancies in the table (`(C1, 1000)` appears multiple times)

To turn this table into 2NF, we split the table as such

1. `R(studentId, courseId)`
2. `R(courseId, courseFee)`

# Third Normal Form (3NF)

A table is in 3NF if and only if, for every functional dependency X -> Y, it satisfies the following

- Either X contains a key (Y is dependent on a full key)
- Each attribute in Y is contained in a key

For example,

- Given R(ABC), A -> B, B -> C
- Keys: A
- We know that A -> B is valid because A is a key
- However B -> C is not valid since B is not a key, and C is not part of any key
- Hence R is not in 3NF

# 3NF Decomposition

Given a table which is not in 3NF, how do we decompose it such that all the decomposed tables are in 3NF?

## Algorithm for 3NF Decomposition

Given a table `R` and a set `S` of FDs,

1. Derive a minimal basis for `S`
2. In the minimal basis, combine together the FDs whose left hand sides are the same
3. Create a table for each remaining FD
4. If none of the tables contain a key of the original table R, create a table that contains the key of R
5. Remove rendundant tables

### Minimal Basis Decomposition

Given a set of FDs S = {A -> BD, AB -> C, C -> D, BC -> D}, find the minimal basis decomposition of S

For a minimal basis, each FD within the minimal basis must satisfy the following conditions:

1. For any FD in the minimal basis, its RHS contains only 1 attribute
2. No FD in the minimal basis is redundant
   - No FD in the minimal basis should be derived from the remaining FDs in the minimal basis
3. For each FD in the minimal basis, none of the attributes on the LHS is redundant
   - If we removed an attribute from the LHS, the resulting FD should be a new FD that cannot be derived from the original set of FDs

So for S,

1. S = {A -> BD, AB -> C, C -> D, BC -> D}, we must ensure that the RHS contains only 1 attribute, hence minimum basis B = { A -> B, A -> D, AB -> C, C -> D, BC -> D}
2. Remove redundant FDs
   - We check whether each FD is redundant, by removing the FD temporarily from B, and checking if we can derive that removed FD from B using the remaining FDs
   - If we cannot, then it is not redundant. If we can, it is redundant and we remove it from B
   - After this step, B = {A -> B, AB -> C, C -> D, BC -> D}
3. Remove redundant attributes on the left hand side
   - Consider all FDs with more than one attribute on the left hand side
   - We can check whether an attribute is rendundant by doing the following:
     - Remove the attribute A, from the FD, and call this new FD F
     - Check whether F can be derived from B (use all FDs in B, including the current one we are checking)
     - If F can be derived from B, then the removed attribute A is rendundant, and we can simplify the FD to exclude the removed attribute
   - E.g.
     - AB -> C, we check whether B is redundant
     - So we must find whether A -> C is "hidden" within B
     - We can see that the closure of A contains C, hence A -> C is indeed hidden within B
     - Hence, AB -> C can be simplified to A -> C
4. Final minimal basis, S = {A -> B, A -> C, C -> D}

### Combine together FDs with the same LHS

- S = {A -> BC, C -> D}

### Create Table with All Remaining FDs

- R1(ABC)
- R2(CD)

Since the key is A, we are done.

However, consider the following:

- R(ABCD) split into R1(AB), R2(CD), with keys {A, C}
- We can see that R1 and R2 cannot join because R1 and R2 do not have any columns in common, hence we cannot perform a lossless join
  - In database design, a lossless join decomposition is a decomposition of a relation into relations. such that a natural join of the two smaller relations yields back the original relation
- Hence we add a table R3(AC), which contains all the keys of R
- Hence the final decomposition is R(ABCD) = R1(AB), R2(CD), R3(AC)

# Properties of 3NF Decomposition

- 3NF Decomposition produces 3NF tables
- Minimal basis is not always unique

# 3NF vs BCNF

- 3NF: All attributes (key-attributes or non-key-attributes) depend (directly or transitively) on candidate keys
  - However candidate keys may have overlapping attributes
  - May result in key atrribute(s) of one key depending on the key attribute(s) of another key
  - For example
    - R(ABCD), with functional dependencies C->B, AB->C, BC->C, with keys {AB} and {AC}
    - Key attributes are A, B, C
    - R is in 3NF, however C -> B means that partial key B depends on partial key C
- BCNF: In all dependencies (FDs), LHS must contain a key (cannot depend on partial key)

Since BCNF is stricter than 3NF,

- If a table is BCNF, it is 3NF
- A table that violates 3NF violates BCNF

- BCNF Decomposition
  - Avoids insertion, deletion, and update anomalies
  - Eliminates most redundancies
  - Does not preserve all FDs
- 3NF Decomposition
  - Avoids insertion, deletion and update anomalies
  - May lead to a bit more redundancy than BCNF
  - Always preserve all FDs, because the minimal basis preserves dependencies

How to choose with NF to use?

- Go for BCNF decomposition first
- If it preserves all FDs, then we are done
- If not, then use 3NF decomposition

# Entity Relationship Diagrams

# What is a Database?

-   A collection of data specially organised for efficient retrieval by a computer

# What is a Database System?

-   A piece of software that helps us efficiently manage/retrieve information from databases
-   Also known as a database management system (DBMS)

# DBMS in Practice

-   Large websites rely heavily on DBMS
    -   Facebook
    -   Twitter
-   Non-web companies also depend on DBMS
    -   Banks
-   Small pieces of software as well
    -   Web browsers

# Relational Model

-   Numerous DBMS exist out in the market
    -   Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, MySQL
-   Most of them follow a relational model: **They store their data in relations**

# Relation

Product

| Name       | Price | Category | Manufacturer |
| ---------- | ----- | -------- | ------------ |
| iPhone 6   | 888   | Phone    | Apple        |
| iPad Air 2 | 999   | Tablet   | Apple        |
| EOS-1D X   | 1199  | Camera   | Canon        |

-   A relation is often called a **table**
-   A row in a table is often called a **record**
-   A column in a table is also called an **attribute** of the table

# Designing Databases for Applications

-   Conceptually model the requirements for the application
    -   What needs to be stored?
    -   How do they interact with one another?
-   We use an Entity-Relation (ER) Diagram
    -   A pictorial and intuitive way for modelling object relations
-   We translate the conceptual model into tables for the DB
-   Construct the table with a DBMS

# ER Diagram

![Example ER Diagram](https://wcs.smartdraw.com/entity-relationship-diagram/img/erd-example.png?bn=15100111801)

![Symbols in ER Diagram](https://d3n817fwly711g.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/ER-Diagram-Elements.jpeg)

## Entity/Entity Set

-   Represented by a rectangle
-   Describes a collection of similar objects
-   E.g. of an entity set: Accounts, People, Companies etc.

## Attribute

-   Represented by an oval
-   Describes the attributes an object has
-   E.g. Person has a name, age, ID etc.

## Relationship

-   Represented by a diamond
-   Shows the connection between 2 related objects
-   E.g. Companies **have** Employees, Companies **make** Products, Users **create** Characters

## Weak Entity

-   Represented by a double rectangle
-   Weak entities depend on some other entity type. They **don't have primary keys** (hence cannot be uniquely identified)
-   Weak entities have no meaning in the diagram without their parent entity, they depend on their parent entity (owner entity)
-   An example of a weak entity:

![Example of weak entity](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190520181337/Untitled-Diagram-231.png)

-   A loan cannot exist without a customer. Hence a loan depends on the existence of a customer, hence is a weak entity
-   The existence of rooms is dependent on the existence of a hotel. So a room can be seen as a weak entity of the hotel

## Weak Relationship

-   Represented by double diamond
-   Shows the connection between a weak entity and its owner

## Multivalued Attribute

-   Represented by double oval
-   An attribute that can hold multiple values
-   E.g. A student can have multiple phone numbers, but only 1 name

# Types of Relationships

There are many different types of relationships between entities

-   One-to-One relationship
-   Many-to-One relationship
-   Many-to-Many relationship

## One-to-One Relationship

![](https://vertabelo.com/blog/one-to-one-relationship-in-database/1-to-1-pk-plus-fk.png)

-   Each country can have only 1 capital
-   Each capital can only be in 1 country

## Many-to-One Relationship

![](https://database.guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/relationship-diagram-one-to-many.png)

-   A customer can only live in 1 city
-   A city can have many customers

## Many-to-Many Relationship

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Databases-ManyToManyWJunction.jpg/1200px-Databases-ManyToManyWJunction.jpg)

-   A book can have many authors, and an author can have many books

## Multi-way Relationships

![](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse444/99au/lectures/odl+er/img015.gif)

-   How do we model a purchase relationship between buyers, products and stores?
-   We can use a 3-way relationship, however the arrows will be complicated

# Roles

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mKoU7.jpg)

-   Sometimes in a relationship, an entity set may appear more than once
-   A course may have another course as a prerequisite
-   Role is specified on the edge connecting the entity set to the relationship

Note: A relationship can have attributes

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/1to1-1.jpg)

-   We can record the start date that an employee manages a department

# Constraints

-   Some conditions that entity sets and relationships should satisfy
-   We will focus on 3 types of constraints
    1. Key constraints
    2. Referential integrity constraints
    3. Degree constraints

## Key Constraints (UNIQUE)

![](/public/key_constraints.png)

-   One or more attributes that are underlined
-   They uniquely represent each entity in the entity set
-   E.g. the name uniquely represents the person - Each person must have a unique name

![](multiple_key_constraints.png)

-   Multiple key constraints:
    -   One or more attributes that are underlined
    -   Each product has a unique <name, category> combination
    -   But there can be products with the same name, or same category, but not both
    -   E.g. name = "apple", category = "fruit" with name = "apple", category = "phone"

Rule: Every entity set should have a key, so that we can uniquely refer to every entity

# Referential Integrity

![](/public/referential_integrity.png)

-   One company makes multiple products
-   One product is made by one company
-   Can there be a product made by 0 companies?
    -   No, every product must be involved in the "make" relationship
    -   Referential integrity constraint
-   We represent it with a round arrow rather than a pointed arrow

## What if every company should make at least 1 product?

-   No arrow, but we indicate with degree constraints
-   In general, referential integrity constraint can only be used on one side of a
    -   Many-to-one relationship
    -   One-to-one relationship

# Degree Constraints

![](/public/degree_constraints.png)

-   Each company should make at least 1 product
-   Degree constraints are not easy to enforce in DBMS
-   Key and referential integrity can be easily enforced

# Subclasses

![](/public/subclasses.png)

-   PhDs are a special type of Student
-   Subclass: special type
-   Connection between subclass and superclass represented by a `isa` relationship, represented with a triangle
-   Key of subclass == Key of superclass
-   E.g. key of PhD == Students.ID

![](/public/multiple_subclasses.png)

-   An entity can have multiple subclasses

# Weak Entity Sets

-   Weak entity sets are a special type of entity set that
    -   cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes
    -   needs attributes from other entities to identify themselves
    -   E.g. Madison in Wisconsin, and Madison in Kansas

![](/public/weak_entity_sets.png)

-   Problem: There are cities with identical names
-   Observation: `Cities` in the same state have different names
-   Solution: Make `Cities` a **weak entity set** associated with the entity set `States`
-   The relationship **in** is called the supporting relationship of `Cities`
-   Weak entity sets: Double-line rectangle
-   Supporting relationship: Double-line diamond
-   The keys of `Cities`: `States.name` and `Cities.name`

> Note: Subclasses are not weak entities. `PhD`s are a special kind of `Student`. A `city` is not a special type of `State`

# Summary

-   Rectangle: Entity
-   Oval: Attribute
-   Line: Many to many (Students -- Classes means a student can have 0 or more classes, a class can have 0 or more students)
-   Sharp arrow: Many to one (Manufacturers <--best sellers-- Beers means that a beer is a best-seller for 0 or 1 manufacturers)
-   Curved arrow: Exactly one (Company c-- Product means each product must have exactly 1 company)

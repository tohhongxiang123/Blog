# Practice Questions in SQL

## Question 1

Let $R(A, B, C, D)$ and $S(C, D, E)$ be 2 relational schema. Let $q$ and $r$ be relations (i.e. tables) on schema $R$, and $s$ be a relation on schema $s$. Convert the following relational algebra queries to SQL

1. $q - r$
2. $\Pi_{A, C} (r) \bowtie \Pi_{C, D} (s)$

### Solution

1. $q - r$ can be written in SQL as

```sql
SELECT * FROM q
EXCEPT SELECT * FROM r;
```

2. $\Pi_{A, C} (r) \bowtie \Pi_{C, D} (s)$

```sql
SELECT r.A, r.C, r.D
FROM r
INNER JOIN s
ON r.C = s.C;
```

## Question 2

Consider the following schema containing airport flight information. Primary keys are bolded.

- FLIGHTS(**flno:integer**, from:string, to:string, distance:integer, departs:time,
  arrives:time)
- AIRCRAFT(**aid:integer**, aname:string, cruisingrange:integer)
- CERTIFIED(**eid:integer**, **aid:integer**)
- EMPLOYEES(**eid:integer**, ename:string, salary:integer)

Note that the `Employees` relation describes pilots and other kinds of employees as well. Every pilot is certified for some aircraft (otherwise he or she would not qualify as a pilot) and only pilots are certified to fly

Give a SQL expression for the following query. Your solution should only be a single SQL statement

> Find the eids of employees who make the second highest salary

### Solution

Let us first find what the highest salary is

```sql
SELECT MAX(Salary)
FROM EMPLOYEES;
```

Now we have to select the second highest salary

```sql
SELECT MAX(Salary)
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY <> (
    SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM EMPLOYEES
);
```

Now we can select all employees who make the second highest salary

```sql
SELECT eid
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE salary = (
    SELECT MAX(Salary)
    FROM EMPLOYEES
    WHERE SALARY <> (
        SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM EMPLOYEES
    )
);
```

## Question 3

Consider the following schema representing a database

- PRODUCT(**model**, manufacturer, type)
- PC(**model**, speed, ram, hd, price)
- LAPTOP(**model**, speed, ram, hd, screen, price)
- PRINTER(**model**, color, type, price)

A `PRODUCT` is either a `PC`, `LAPTOP` or `PRINTER` and must have a tuple in the corresponding table. There is a foreign key constraint on the model of PCs, Laptops and Printers referencing the primary key model of `PRODUCT`

Express the following queries in SQL. Your solution should be only one SQL statement

> Find the manufacturer(s) of computer (PC or laptop) with the highest available speed

### Solution

Select all PCs and Laptops

```sql
SELECT PC.model, PC.speed
FROM PC
UNION
SELECT LAPTOP.model, LAPTOP.speed
FROM LAPTOP
```

Get the model with the highest speed

```sql
SELECT model
FROM (
    SELECT PC.model, PC.speed
    FROM PC
    UNION
    SELECT LAPTOP.model, LAPTOP.speed
    FROM LAPTOP
) AS Computer
WHERE Computer.speed = (
    SELECT MAX(Computer1.speed)
    FROM (
        SELECT PC.model, PC.speed
        FROM PC
        UNION
        SELECT LAPTOP.model, LAPTOP.speed
        FROM LAPTOP
    ) AS Computer1
);
```

Get the manufacturer of the models

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT manufacturer
FROM PRODUCT
WHERE model IN (
    SELECT model
    FROM (
        SELECT PC.model, PC.speed
        FROM PC
        UNION
        SELECT LAPTOP.model, LAPTOP.speed
        FROM LAPTOP
    ) AS Computer
    WHERE Computer.speed = (
        SELECT MAX(Computer1.speed)
        FROM (
            SELECT PC.model, PC.speed
            FROM PC
            UNION
            SELECT LAPTOP.model, LAPTOP.speed
            FROM LAPTOP
        ) AS Computer1
    )
);
```

## Question 4

Given the following schema:

- STUDENT(**Sid**, SName, Sex, Age, Year, GPA)
- COURSE(**Cno**, CName, DName)
- ENROLL(**Sid**, Grade, Dname, Cno, Sectno)

Find the ids, names and GPAs of the students who have taken all courses from "Civil Engineering" department.

### Solution

```sql
SELECT Sid, SName, GPA
FROM STUDENT AS S
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT C.Cno
    FROM COURSE AS C
    WHERE DName = 'Civil Engineering'
    EXCEPT
    SELECT E.CNo
    FROM ENROLL E
    WHERE DName = 'Civil Engineering'
    AND E.Sid = S.Sid
);
```

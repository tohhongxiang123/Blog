# Relational Algebra

-   We now have the specification of a DB application
-   We used an ER diagram for a conceptual design of our database
-   We transformed the ER-diagram into a database schema
-   We normalize the schema, and then inserted some tuples into the table
-   Now we can extract useful information about of application with **queries**
    -   Database side: Relation algebra
    -   User side: Strucuted Query Language

Relational algebra is a mathematical way to formulate queries on relations. There are multiple operators used for query formulation

-   Consider 2 relations $R_1(A, B, C), R_2(A, B, C)$
-   Selection: $\sigma_{A > 100} R_1$
-   Projection: $\Pi_{A, B} R_1$
-   Union: $R_1 \cup R_2$
-   Intersection: $R_1 \cap R_2$
-   And more

# Selection $\sigma$ (Row-wise operation)

Consider a students table

| ID\* | Name  | Age | School |
| ---- | ----- | --- | ------ |
| 1    | Alice | 20  | SCSE   |
| 2    | Bob   | 20  | EEE    |
| 3    | Cathy | 22  | SCSE   |
| 4    | David | 21  | CEE    |

Imagine we wanted to query the database: "Find me the student named Alice"

$$
\sigma_{name=Alice} Students
$$

Results:

| ID\* | Name  | Age | School |
| ---- | ----- | --- | ------ |
| 1    | Alice | 20  | SCSE   |

Query: Find students in SCSE

$$
\sigma_{school = SCSE} Students
$$

| ID\* | Name  | Age | School |
| ---- | ----- | --- | ------ |
| 1    | Alice | 20  | SCSE   |
| 3    | Cathy | 22  | SCSE   |

Query: Find SCSE students under 21 years old

$$
\sigma_{(school = SCSE) \land (Age < 21)} Students
$$

| ID\* | Name  | Age | School |
| ---- | ----- | --- | ------ |
| 1    | Alice | 20  | SCSE   |

Query: Find students who are **either** in SCSE **or** under 21

$$
\sigma_{(school = SCSE) \lor (Age < 21)} Students
$$

| ID\* | Name  | Age | School |
| ---- | ----- | --- | ------ |
| 1    | Alice | 20  | SCSE   |
| 2    | Bob   | 20  | EEE    |
| 3    | Cathy | 22  | SCSE   |

# Projection $\Pi$ (Column-wise)

Query: Find the IDs and Names of all students

$$
\Pi_{ID, Name} Students
$$

| ID\* | Name  |
| ---- | ----- |
| 1    | Alice |
| 2    | Bob   |
| 3    | Cathy |

## Combining Operators

Find the IDs and Names of all students in SCSE

$$
\Pi_{ID, Name}(\sigma_{School = SCSE} Students)
$$

| ID\* | Name  |
| ---- | ----- |
| 1    | Alice |
| 3    | Cathy |

Note that $\sigma_{School = SCSE}(\Pi_{ID, Name} Students)$ will not work, because the relation that results from $\Pi_{ID, Name} Students$ does not contain the School column

# Union $\cup$

Students

| Name  | Age |
| ----- | --- |
| Alice | 20  |
| Bob   | 21  |
| Cathy | 22  |
| David | 21  |

Volunteers

| Name  | Age |
| ----- | --- |
| Cathy | 22  |
| David | 21  |
| Eddie | 43  |
| Fred  | 35  |

Query: Find people who are either students or volunteers

$$
Students \cup Volunteers
$$

| Name  | Age |
| ----- | --- |
| Alice | 20  |
| Bob   | 21  |
| Cathy | 22  |
| David | 21  |
| Eddie | 43  |
| Fred  | 35  |

Query: Find the names of people who are either students or volunteers

$$
\Pi_{Name} (Students \cup Volunteers) \\
= (\Pi_{Name} Students) \cup (\Pi_{Name} Volunteers)
$$

Note that

1. The union removes duplicate tuples
2. The schema on both sides must be the same

Consider these 2 new tables. Note that they have different attributes

Students

| Name  | Age |
| ----- | --- |
| Alice | 20  |
| Bob   | 21  |
| Cathy | 22  |
| David | 21  |

Volunteers

| Name  |
| ----- |
| Cathy |
| David |
| Eddie |
| Fred  |

I want to find people who are either students or volunteers

However, in this case, $Students \cup Volunteers$ will not work because the **2 sides of a union must have the same schema**.

The correct solution is

$$
(\Pi_{Name} Students) \cup Volunteers
$$

# Intersection $\cap$

Find people who are both students **and** volunteers

$$
Students \cap Volunteers
$$

Do note that

1. Duplicate tuples are automatically removed
2. Both sides must have the same schema

# Difference $-$

Query: Find the people who are students **but not** volunteers.

$$
Students - Volunteers
$$

Do note that

1. Duplicate tuples are automatically removed
2. Both sides must have the same schema

For example, if `Students(Name, ID)` and `Volunteers(Name, Age)` are 2 relations, and we want to find all students that are not volunteers

$$
\Pi_{Name} Students - \Pi_{Name} Volunteers
$$

# Exercise

Consider the following table `Grades`

| Name\* | Course\* | Grade |
| ------ | -------- | ----- |
| Alice  | DB       | A     |
| Alice  | DM       | C     |
| Bob    | DB       | B     |
| Bob    | AI       | B     |
| Cathy  | CG       | A     |
| David  | NN       | C     |

1. Find all students that have taken DB and DM, but not AI or CG

We might decide that the appropriate query is just

$$
(\sigma_{Course = DB} Grades \cap \sigma_{Course = DM} Grades) \\
- (\sigma_{Course = AI} Grades \cap \sigma_{Course = CG} Grades)
$$

However, this is the wrong answer, as it leaves us with an empty set. Let us take a closer look at this query

$\sigma_{Course = DB} Grades$:

| Name\* | Course\* | Grade |
| ------ | -------- | ----- |
| Alice  | DB       | A     |
| Bob    | DB       | B     |

$\sigma_{Course = DM} Grades)$

| Name\* | Course\* | Grade |
| ------ | -------- | ----- |
| Alice  | DM       | C     |

$(\sigma_{Course = DB} Grades \cap \sigma_{Course = DM} Grades)$

| Name\* | Course\* | Grade |
| ------ | -------- | ----- |

See how there is no intersection here because both queries return different rows - (Alice, DM, C) and (Alice, DB, A) are 2 different rows, hence are not preserved after the intersection.

What we need to do is filter them out by name first, then perform the union.

$$
(\Pi_{Name}\sigma_{Course = DB} Grades \cap \Pi_{Name}\sigma_{Course = DM} Grades) \\
- (\Pi_{Name}\sigma_{Course = AI} Grades \cap \Pi_{Name}\sigma_{Course = CG} Grades)
$$

Now we can see that:

$\Pi_{Name}\sigma_{Course = DB} Grades$:

| Name\* |
| ------ |
| Alice  |
| Bob    |

$\Pi_{Name}\sigma_{Course = DM} Grades)$

| Name\* |
| ------ |
| Alice  |

$(\Pi_{Name}\sigma_{Course = DB} Grades \cap \Pi_{Name}\sigma_{Course = DM} Grades)$

| Name\* |
| ------ |
| Alice  |

We can see now that the query will provide the correct result.

2. Find the names of all students that have never taken DM

$$
\Pi_{Name}\sigma_{Course \neq DM} Grades
$$

will not give the correct answer. Let us look closely at the result of $\sigma_{Course \neq DM} Grades$:

| Name\* | Course\* | Grade |
| ------ | -------- | ----- |
| Alice  | DB       | A     |
| Bob    | DB       | B     |
| Bob    | AI       | B     |
| Cathy  | CG       | A     |
| David  | NN       | C     |

The query selects all rows where `Course != DM`. We can see that Alice's name still appears above, even though she has taken DM before. Instead of the query above, we must do the following query:

$$
\Pi_{Name}Grades - \Pi_{Name}\sigma_{Course = DM} Grades
$$

# Natural Join $\bowtie$

The natural join merges 2 tables together by a common attribute. If we have 2 tables R1(A, B, C) and R2(C, D, E), then $R_1 \bowtie R_2 = R(A, B, C, D, E)$, where all the rows are where $R_1(C) = R_2(C)$

Students

| NRIC\* | Name  |
| ------ | ----- |
| 11     | Alice |
| 2      | Bob   |
| 33     | Cathy |
| 4      | David |

Phones

| NRIC\* | Number\* |
| ------ | -------- |
| 11     | 91234567 |
| 11     | 12345678 |
| 33     | 98232357 |
| 5      | 98765432 |

Query: Find the NRIC, Name, and Phone of each student

$$
Students \bowtie Phones
$$

| NRIC\* | Name  | Number\* |
| ------ | ----- | -------- |
| 11     | Alice | 91234567 |
| 11     | Alice | 12345678 |
| 33     | Cathy | 98232357 |

Note

-   The join is performed based on the common attributes of the 2 relations
-   Each common attribute appears only once in the result
-   If one side has an entry, but the other side has no corresponding entry, it will not be in the result

Consider another set of tables here:

Students

| Name  | School |
| ----- | ------ |
| Alice | SCSE   |
| Bob   | EEE    |
| Cathy | CEE    |
| David | SCSE   |

Donations

| Name  | Amount |
| ----- | ------ |
| Cathy | 100    |
| David | 200    |
| Eddie | 300    |
| Fred  | 400    |

Query: Find the name, schools and donation amounts of the students from SCSE who made a donation

$$
\sigma_{School = SCSE}(Students \bowtie Donations)
$$

Or

$$
(\sigma_{School = SCSE} Students) \bowtie Donations
$$

Consider another set of tables:

Grades

| Name\* | Course\* | Grades |
| ------ | -------- | ------ |
| Alice  | DB       | A      |
| Alice  | DM       | C      |
| Bob    | DB       | B      |
| Bob    | NN       | B      |
| Cathy  | SP       | B      |
| Cathy  | NN       | A      |

CrsSch

| Course\* | School\* |
| -------- | -------- |
| DB       | SCSE     |
| DM       | SCSE     |
| AI       | SCSE     |
| NN       | EEE      |
| SP       | EEE      |

Query: Find all students that have taken SCSE courses but not EEE courses

We split this into 2 tables:

1. All the students who have taken SCSE courses

$$
R_1 = (\sigma_{School = SCSE}CrsSch) \bowtie Grades
$$

2. All the students who have taken EEE courses

$$
R_2 = (\sigma_{School = EEE}CrsSch) \bowtie Grades
$$

The final required query is

$$
\Pi_{Name} (R_1) - \Pi_{Name} (R_2)
$$

Now, if we wanted to find all the students that took only EEE courses, we must use the following query

1. All students that took EEE courses

$$
R_1 = (\sigma_{School = EEE} CrsSch) \bowtie Grades
$$

2. All students that took SCSE courses

$$
R_2 = (\sigma_{School = SCSE} CrsSch) \bowtie Grades
$$

The final output is

$$
\Pi_{name} R_1 - \Pi_{name} R_2
$$

# Theta Join $\bowtie_{\theta}$

A natural join with a specific condition $\theta$ that must be satisfied.

A natural join is a theta join with the condition that all the common columns must be equal between tables

If $R_1(A_1, A_2, ..., A_m, B_1, B_2, ..., B_n)$ and $R_2(B_1, ..., B_n, C_1, ..., C_p)$, then

$$
R_1 \bowtie R_2 \cong R_1 \bowtie_{R_1(X) = R_2(X) \forall x \in Cols_{R_1} \cup Cols_{R_2}} R_2
$$

Consider the following 3 tables

Students

| Sname\* | School\* |
| ------- | -------- |
| Alice   | SCSE     |
| Bob     | EEE      |
| Cathy   | CEE      |
| David   | SCSE     |

Donations

| Name\* | Amount |
| ------ | ------ |
| Cathy  | 100    |
| David  | 200    |
| Eddie  | 300    |
| Fred   | 400    |

Query: For those students who have made donations, find their names, schools, and amounts of their donations

$$
Students \bowtie_{Students.Sname = Donations.Name} Donations
$$

Result:

| Sname\* | Name\* | School | Amount |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Cathy   | Cathy  | CEE    | 100    |
| David   | David  | SCSE   | 200    |

-   Difference between natural join and theta join: Duplicate **attributes** will not be removed from the query
-   In general, the condition for a join can be an inequality as well

For example, given 2 tables `Quiz1` and `Quiz2`, both with columns `Name` and `Score`, find all students who scored higher in quiz 1 than quiz 2

$$
Quiz1 \bowtie_{Quiz1.Name = Quiz2.Name \land Quiz1.Score > Quiz2.Score} Quiz2
$$

# Cartesian Product $\times$

A cartesian product is a theta join without a condition. It joins every row in table 1 with every other row in table 2. For example:

Students

| Name\* | Age |
| ------ | --- |
| Alice  | 19  |
| Bob    | 22  |

Courses

| ID\* | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| C1   | DB   |
| C2   | Algo |

Query: Create a table that provides all students-courses combinations

$$
Students \times Courses
$$

| Name\* | Age | ID\* | Name |
| ------ | --- | ---- | ---- |
| Alice  | 19  | C1   | DB   |
| Alice  | 19  | C2   | Algo |
| Bob    | 22  | C1   | DB   |
| Bob    | 22  | C2   | Algo |

# Assignment $:=$

Make a copy of the table, and assign it a new name

Consider the following table:

Quiz1

| Name\* | Score |
| ------ | ----- |
| Alice  | 70    |
| Bob    | 90    |
| Cathy  | 80    |
| David  | 100   |

$Assignment1 = Quiz1$ will create a copy of the Quiz1 table, and put the results in a new table called Assignment1

$Over85 = \sigma_{Score > 85} Quiz1$ will first filter all entries whose score is > 85, then assign the result into a new table called Over85

Assignment is useful for breaking down steps, as you can assign intermediate tables into a variable. For example:

$$
(\Pi_{Name} Students) \cup (\Pi_{Name} Volunteers)
$$

can be written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
R_1 &= (\Pi_{Name} Students) \\
R_2 &= (\Pi_{Name} Volunteers) \\
R_1 &\cup R_2
\end{aligned}
$$

# Rename $\rho$

Renaming is similar to assignment, however also allows changes in column names

For example, consider a table `Quiz1(Name, Score)`

Rename the table `Quiz1` to `Evaluation1`

$$
\rho_{Evaluation1} Quiz1
$$

Rename `Quiz1` to `Eval1`, with the columns renamed to `SName, QScore`

$$
\rho_{Eval1(SName, QScore)} Quiz1
$$

# Duplicate Elimination $\delta$

Eliminates duplicate tuples (rows)

For example,

Purchase

| Name\* | Product\* | Date\*     |
| ------ | --------- | ---------- |
| Alice  | iPhone    | 2021.01.01 |
| Bob    | xBox      | 2021.01.01 |
| Cathy  | iPhone    | 2021.01.01 |
| David  | xBox      | 2021.01.02 |

Find all the products sold on 2021.01.01

$$
R_1 := \Pi_{Product} \sigma_{Date=2021.01.01} Purchase
$$

Give:

| Product\* |
| --------- |
| iPhone    |
| xBox      |
| iPhone    |

$$
\delta(R_1)
$$

| Product\* |
| --------- |
| iPhone    |
| xBox      |

# Extended Projection $\Pi$

Similar to normal projection, however with extended projection, we can create new columns with arithmetic/boolean operations

For example:

Grades

| Name\* | Quiz1\* | Quiz2\* |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| Alice  | 70      | 90      |
| Bob    | 90      | 80      |
| Cathy  | 80      | 100     |
| David  | 100     | 90      |

To find the total grades for each person, we can use the extended projection

$$
\Pi_{Name, Quiz1 + Quiz2 \to Total} Scores
$$

$Quiz1 + Quiz2 \to Total$ calculates the expression $Quiz1 + Quiz2$ and assigns it to a new column $Total$

Similarly, if we wanted to find the average grade for each person, we can do

$$
\Pi_{Name, (Quiz1 + Quiz2)/2 \to Average} Scores
$$

# Aggregation/Grouping $\gamma$

## Aggregation

Quiz1

| Name  | School | Score |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| Alice | SCSE   | 90    |
| Bob   | EEE    | 80    |
| Cathy | EEE    | 100   |
| David | SCSE   | 90    |

To get the maximum score in Quiz1, we can use the query

$$
\gamma_{MAX(Score) \to MaxScore} Quiz1
$$

This gives the following result:

| MaxScore |
| -------- |
| 100      |

For the minimum score, we can use the query

$$
\gamma_{MIN(Score) \to MinScore} Quiz1
$$

To find the sum, we can use

$$
\gamma_{SUM(Score) \to SumScore} Quiz1
$$

To find the number of students, we can use

$$
\gamma_{COUNT(Name) \to NumStudent} Quiz1
$$

## Aggregate Functions

-   MAX(...)
-   MIN(...)
-   AVG(...)
-   SUM(...)
-   COUNT(...)

## Grouping

Grades

| Name\* | School | GPA |
| ------ | ------ | --- |
| Alice  | SCSE   | 4   |
| Bob    | EEE    | 3   |
| Cathy  | EEE    | 3.4 |
| David  | SCSE   | 3.6 |

To get the average GPA per school, we can use the following query

$$
\gamma_{School, AVG(GPA) \to AvgGPA} Grades
$$

This query divides the tuples into separate schools based on `School` column, then performs the aggregate function on the `GPA` column. This results in the following table:

| School | AvgGPA |
| ------ | ------ |
| SCSE   | 3.8    |
| EEE    | 3.2    |

To find the average and maximum GPA in the school,

$$
\gamma_{School, AVG(GPA) \to AvgGPA, MAX(GPA) \to MaxGPA} Grades
$$

Consider another table:

Quiz1

| Name  | School | Year | GPA |
| ----- | ------ | ---- | --- |
| Alice | SCSE   | 3    | 4   |
| Bob   | EEE    | 1    | 3   |
| Cathy | EEE    | 2    | 3.4 |
| David | SCSE   | 3    | 3.6 |

If we want to aggregate by school and year, we can use the following query

$$
\gamma_{School, Year, AVG(GPA) \to GPA} Grades
$$

| School | Year | GPA |
| ------ | ---- | --- |
| SCSE   | 3    | 3.8 |
| EEE    | 1    | 3   |
| EEE    | 2    | 3.4 |

# Division $\div$

The $\div$ operator is also known as the inverse of the cartesian product. If we have relations $U, R, S$ such that $U = R \times S$, then division is the operator such that $U \div R = S$ and $U \div S = R$

In general, $R_1(A, B) \div R_2(B)$ returns a table that only contains $A$. The resultant table contains each value $A$ in $R_1$ that is associated with **every value in B** in $R_2$

Or, simply put: Find all the $A$ that $R_1$ all the $B$ in $R_2$

Consider the following tables

Owns

| Name  | Product |
| ----- | ------- |
| Alice | iPad    |
| Alice | iPhone  |
| Bob   | iPad    |
| Cathy | iPhone  |

AppleP

| Product |
| ------- |
| iPhone  |
| iPad    |

Query: Find each person that owns all apple products

$$
Owns \div AppleP
$$

| Name  |
| ----- |
| Alice |

If the tables were

Owns

| Name  | Product |
| ----- | ------- |
| Alice | iPad    |
| Alice | iPhone  |
| Bob   | iPad    |
| Cathy | iPhone  |

AppleP

| Product | Price |
| ------- | ----- |
| iPhone  | 999   |
| iPad    | 699   |

Then the correct query would be

$$
Owns \div \Pi_{Product} AppleP
$$

## Exercise

1. Consider the following 2 tables

Grades

| Name  | Course | Grade |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| Alice | DB     | A     |
| Alice | DM     | C     |
| Bob   | DB     | B     |

| ------ | ------ |
| DB     | SCSE   |
| DM     | SCSE   |
| NN     | EEE    |
| SP     | EEE    |

Query: Find students who have taken all courses from SCSE

$$
\begin{aligned}
R_1 &= \Pi_{Course} \sigma_{School = SCSE} CrsSch \\
R_2 &= \Pi_{Course, Name} Grades \\
R_3 &= R_2 \div R_1
\end{aligned}
$$

2. Consider the following 2 tables

Grades

| Name  | Course | Grade |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| Alice | DB     | A     |
| Alice | DM     | C     |
| Bob   | DB     | B     |

| DB     | SCSE   |
| DM     | SCSE   |
| NN     | EEE    |
| SP     | EEE    |

Query: Find the students who have taken all courses from SCSE but not all courses from EEE

$$
\begin{aligned}
R_1 &= \Pi_{Course} \sigma_{School = SCSE} CrsSch \\
R_2 &= \Pi_{Name, Course} Grades \\
R_3 &= R_2 \div R_1 \ (\text{Students that take all SCSE courses}) \\
R_4 &= \Pi_{Course} \sigma_{School = EEE} CrsSch \\
R_5 &= R_2 \div R_4 \ (\text{Students that take all EEE courses}) \\
R_6 &= R_3 - R_5
\end{aligned}
$$

# Left Outer Join $\mathring{\bowtie}_L$

A left outerjoin merges 2 tables together such that the result includes unmatched rows from only the table that is specified on the left. If there are unmatched rows on the right table, they are not included in the result

Consider the following tables:

Students

| Name  | School |
| ----- | ------ |
| Alice | SCSE   |
| Bob   | EEE    |
| Cathy | CEE    |
| David | SCSE   |

Donations

| Name  | Amount |
| ----- | ------ |
| Cathy | 100    |
| David | 200    |
| Eddie | 300    |
| Fred  | 400    |

Query: For each student, find the amount of his/her donation

$$
Students \mathring{\bowtie}_L Donations
$$

| Name  | School | Amount |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| Alice | SCSE   | NULL   |
| Bob   | EEE    | NULL   |
| Cathy | CEE    | 100    |
| David | SCSE   | 200    |

-   All tuples in students are retained in the result
-   For each student who did not make a donation, the amount is `NULL`

For left outerjoin, just like theta join, we can also specify a condition to join on

$$
Students \mathring{\bowtie}_{L \ Students.SName = Donations.Name} Donations
$$

# Right Outerjoin $\mathring{\bowtie}_R$

Similar to left outerjoin, but it retains all tuples on the right relation, and any tuples that do not have a corresponding match on the left relation has values set to `NULL`

$$
Students \mathring{\bowtie}_R Donations
$$

| Name  | School | Amount |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| Cathy | SCSE   | 100    |
| David | EEE    | 200    |
| Eddie | NULL   | 300    |
| Fred  | NULL   | 400    |

And similarly to left join, we can denote a condition as well

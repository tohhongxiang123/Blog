# Boyce-Codd Normal Form

# Normal Forms

- Normalisation is the process of minimising redundancy from a relation or a set of relations. Redundancies in relations may cause insertion/deletion/update anomalies
- In increasing order of strictness,

1. First normal form
2. Second normal form
3. Third normal form
4. Boyce-Codd normal form
5. Fourth normal form
6. Fifth normal form
7. Sixth normal form

- 3NF and BCNF are most commonly used

# Boyce-Codd Normal Form

> A table R is in BCNF if and only if the left hand side of every non-trivial FD contains a **key** of R

- Non-trivial FD
  - An FD that is not implied by the axiom of reflexivity
  - E.g. A -> B and AC -> BC are non-trivial, but AC -> A and AC -> C are trivial

E.g.,

- Given a table R(A, B) and FD A->B, and key A, is R in BCNF?
- All non-trivial FDs on R: A -> B
- Left hand side of A -> B contains a key
- Therefore R is in BCNF

# Procedure to check if R is in BCNF

Given a table R, and a set of FDs on R

1. Derive all the keys of R
2. Derive all the non-trivial FDs on R
   - We only need to check the FDs given to us on R
   - Because if all the given FDs on R pass the check, any other non-trivial FD (which are all derived from the given FDs) on R will pass the check as well
   - Any derived FDs will either 1. Have the same LHS as the given FDs, or 2. Have a LHS with more attributes
     - We ignore any FDs derived from the reflexivity axiom, because this yields trivial FDs
     - Augmentation axiom: LHS of new FD will have more attributes (A -> B becomes AC -> BC) - If original LHS contains a key, so will the new LHS
     - Transitivity axiom: LHS of new FD will be the same as original LHS (A->B and B->C yields A->C)
3. For each non-trivial FD, check if left hand side contains a key
   - Note that if a table has only 2 attributes, it must be in BCNF ([Proof](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33455459/how-is-every-binary-relation-bcnf/50202899))
4. If all FDs pass the check, then R is in BCNF. Otherwise, R is not in BCNF

# BCNF Intuition

- BCNF requires that there cannot be any non-trivial X->Y such that X does not contain a key
- If X is not a key, X is non-unique, hence there can be repeated entries of X->Y, which implies **redundancies exist**

# BCNF Decomposition

Given R(A, B, C, D) and A->B, B->C, C->D, and key of R: A

1. Identify FD that violates BCNF

B -> C is a violation, as the FD is non-trivial, and B is not a key

2. Compute the closure of the LHS of the violating FD

$\{B\}^+ = \{B, C, D\}$

3. Decompose R into 2 tables

   - $R_1$, containing all attributes in the closure ($R_1(B, C, D)$)
   - $R_2$, containing B and all attributes not in the closure ($R_2(A, B)$)

4. Check if $R_1$ and $R_2$ are in BCNF. IF they are, we are done. If they are not, decompose the table that violates BCNF further down by repeating 1-3

# Tricky Case of BCNF

- R(A, B, C, D, E)
- A -> B, BC -> D
- Key of R: ACE

We can see immediately that A -> B is a violation of BCNF. Hence, we can decompose R by computing the closure of A

$\{A\}^+ = \{A, B\}$

- R1(A, B) and R2(A, C, D, E)
- R1 is in BCNF, but R2 is not

We have a tricky case in BCNF decomposition if

- We are checking whether table T satisfies BCNF, and there is an FD X->Y such that
  - X contains some attribute in T
  - Y contains some attribute not in T
  - In this example, A->B is an FD, but B is not in R2
  - We will use closures to check whether R2 is in BCNF

For R2, since $\{A\}^+ = \{A, B\}$, but R2 does not contain B, $\{A\}^+ = \{A\}$. Similarly, $\{A\}^+ = \{A\}$ and $\{D\}^+ = \{D\}$ and $\{E\}^+ = \{E\}$. All those are trivial FDs, and do not indicate violation of BCNF.

We skip $\{AB\}^+$ since B is not in R2. However $\{AC\}^+ = \{ACD\}$, which indicates that AC -> D, and AC does not contain the key ACE of R2. This implies R2 is not in BCNF, and we further decompose R2.

$\{AC\}^+ = \{ACD\}$, therefore R3(A, C, D) and R4(A, C, E)

- We know R4 is in BCNF (Since ACE is the key)
- However to figure out if R3 is in BCNF, we require closures again
  - $\{A\}+ = \{A\}, \{C\}+ = \{C\}, \{D\}+ = \{D\}$ are all trivial
  - $\{AC\}^+ = \{ABCD\} = \{ACD\}$ since B is not in R3. We can see that since AC determines all attributes of R3, AC is a key of R3, and does not violate BCNF
  - $\{AD\}^+ = \{ABD\} = \{AD\}, $\{CD\}^+ = \{CD\}$ is trivial
- After looking at all the possible closures on R3, we figure out that R3 is in BCNF

# Properties of BCNF Decomposition

- No update/deletion anomalies
- Small redundancy
- Original table can always be reconstructed from decomposed table (Lossless join property)
  - BCNF guarantees lossless joins because, when a table R is decomposed into 2 tables R1 and R2, the common attributes of R1 and R2 always constitute a superkey of R1 or R2
  - More information [here](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/125355/lossless-join-in-3nf/125746) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33963874/bcnf-decompositions-and-lossless-joins-for-databases)
  - You can check whether decomposition is lossless [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ3ME7oOupU)
- However, BCNF may not preserve all functional dependencies
  - For example,
  - Given R(A, B, C) with AB -> C, C -> B, keys {AB}, {AC}
  - BCNF decomposition gives R1(B, C) and R2(A, C)
  - However we can see that the FD AB->C is "lost", as it is neither in R1 nor R2
  - Hence, BCNF may not preserve all functional dependencies

## Why do we want to preserve FDs?

- It makes it easier to avoid inappropriate updates
- For the previous example, since we know AB -> C, we know that we cannot have 2 tuples (a1, b1, c1) and (a1, b1, c2) (Remember for an FD, the left hand side should uniquely determine the right hand side)
- However, since we store A and B separately in tables R1 and R2, we cannot check easily if the tuple (a1, b1) already exists
- Not good
- We can solve this problem by relaxing our strictness, and using third normal form (3NF) instead of BCNF

# Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree

A minimum spanning tree is a connected, acyclic subgraph containing **all the vertices of a graph** with a **minimum summed edge weight**. The weight of a tree refers to the sum of the weights of all the edges in the tree.

# Main Idea of Prim's Algorithm

- Works on undirected graph
- Builds upon a single partial minimum spanning tree; At each step adding an edge connecting the vertex nearest to, but not already in the current partial minimum spanning tree
- At first a vertex is chosen, this vertex will be the first node in the minmum spanning tree set, $T$
- Set $P$ is initialised, where $P$ is the set of vertices not in $T$ but are adjacent to some vertices in $T$
- In every iteration of Prim's algorithm, a new vertex $u$ from $P$ will be connected to the tree $T$. The vertex $u$ will be deleted from the set $P$. The vertices adjacent to $u$ that are not already in $P$ will be added to $P$
- When all vertices are connected to $T$, $P$ will be empty, which signals the end of the algorithm
- The new vertex in every iteration will be chosen greedily - Among all vertices adjacent to $T$ but themselves are not in $T$, we choose the one with the minimum cost

# Pseudocode

```
Initialise empty priority queue Q;

For each vertex v {
    distances[v] = INFINITY; // distance is infinity
    isVisited[v] = 0; // all vertices are not visited
    predecessors[v] = -1; // each vertice has no parent
}

distances[start] = 0;
isVisited[start] = 0;

Q.insertWithPriority(start, distances[start]);
while Q is not empty:
    currentNode = Q.getMinimum();
    Q.removeMinimum();
    isVisited[currentNode] = 1;

    for all nodes neigborNode adjacent to currentNode:
        if isVisited[neigborNode]:
            continue;
        
        newWeight = graph[currentNode][neigborNode]
        if newWeight < distances[neighborNode]:
            distances[neighborNode] = newWeight;
            predecessors[neighborNode] = currentNode;
            Q.decreasePriority(neighborNode, newWeight);

# Minimum Spanning Tree Property

> Let $T$ be a spanning tree of $G$, where $G = (V, E, W)$ is a connected weighted graph. Suppose that for every edge $(u, v)$ of $G$ that is not in $T$. If $(u, v)$ is added to $T$ it creates a cycle such that $(u, v)$ is a maximum weight edge on that cycle. Then $T$ has the minimum spanning tree property.

This is saying that, for any minimum spanning tree $T$, if we added another edge $(u, v)$ not in $T$, and this edge creates a cycle such that $(u, v)$ is the edge with the maximum weight in that cycle, then $T$ is a minimum spanning tree.

## Lemma 1

> In a connected weighted graph $G = (V, E, W)$, if $T_1$ and $T_2$ are 2 spanning trees that have the MST property, then they have the same total weight

Proof by induction on $k$, the number of edges in $T_1$ but not in $T_2$ (there are also $k$ edges in $T_2$ but not in $T_1$)

Basis:

$k = 0$, which means that all edges in $T_1$ are in $T_2$. Therefore $T_1 = T_2$, they have the same weight

Inductive: For $k > 0$, assume that the hypothesis holds for $j$ differing elements where $0 \leq j < k$

Let $uv$ be the minimum differing weight edge between the differing edges ($uv$ is in $T_2$ but not $T_1$)

Consider the path in $T_1$ that connects $u$ and $v$

Suppose that path in $T_1$ is $w_0, w_1, ..., w_p$, where $w_0 = u$ and $w_p = v$. This path must contain some edge that is different from $T_2$

Let $w_i w_{i+1}$ be this differing edge

By MST property of $T_1$, $w_i w_{i+1}$ cannot be greater than $uv$'s weight

However, since $uv$ was chosen to be the minimum weight among differing edges, $w_i w_{i+1}$ cannot weigh less than $uv$

Thus, $W(w_i w_{i+1}) = W(uv)$

Add $uv$ to $T_1$, which creates a cycle. Remove $w_i w_{i+1}$, leaving a tree $T_1'$, which has the same weight as $T_1$

But $T_1'$ and $T_2$ differ in only $k-1$ edges.

By inductive hypothesis, $T_1'$ and $T_2$ have the same total weight, hence $T_1$ and $T_2$ have the same weight.

# Theorem 1

> In a connected weighted graph $G = (V, E, W)$, a tree $T$ is a minimum spanning tree if and only if it has the MST property

Proof by contradiction (only if)

Assume $T$ is a MST for $G$, but does not satisfy the MST property (There is some edge $uv$ in $T$ that creates a cycle, in which some other edge $xy$ has a weight larger that $uv$)

By removing $xy$ and adding $uv$, we create a new spanning tree $T'$, whose total weight is less than the weight of $T$

This contradicts the assumption that $T$ is an $MST$

Hence, $T$ can only be a MST if it supports the MST property

Proof by contradiction (if)

Assume $T$ satisfies the MST property, but is not an MST. Assume that another tree $T_{min}$ is the MST for $G$. If $T_{min}$ is an MST, by the first half of the proof above, we know that $T_{min}$ holds the MST property

By lemma 1, if $T$ and $T_{min}$ both hold the MST property, they have the same total weight.

Therefore, $T$ is an MST if $T$ supports the MST property

# Theorem 2

> Lemma 2: Let $G = (V, E, W)$ be a connected weighted graph; Let $T_k$ be the tree with $k$ vertices constructed by Primâ€™s Algorithm, for $k = 1, 2, \cdots, n$; and let $G_k$ be the subgraph induced by the vertices of $T_k$. Then $T_k$ has the MST property in $G_k$. 

> Theorem 2: Prim's algorithm outputs a minimum spanning tree

Proof:

We know that Prim's algorithm outputs a tree $T_n$. From lemma 2, $T_n$ has the MST property. Hence, by theorem 1, $T_n$ is a minimum spanning tree

# Time Complexity

Similarly to Djikstra's algorithm,

If an adjacency matrix was used, with a normal linear search to find the minimum vertex not within the spanning tree, it will take $O(V^2)$,

Using a binary heap and an adjacency list will reduce this to $O((V + E) \log V)$

When the matrix is dense, the best performance occurs when an adjacency matrix with normal linear search is used, with $O(V^2)$

When the matrix is sparse, the best performance occurs with the binary heap, giving $O(E \log V)$

# Security in Operating Systems

Complex OSes have multiple users. Sharing resources safely between multiple users is hard

-   How to prevent some people from reading private data
-   How to prevent users from using too many resources
-   How to prevent people from interfering with other programs

# Responsibilities of the OS

Functionalities

-   Support multiple concurrent users
-   Manage multiple apps concurrently
-   Connect to network
-   Sharing data with different domains

Security

-   Protect users from each other
-   Protect apps from each other
-   Protect system from the network
-   Secure the data sharing

A system is secure if resources used and accessed as intended under all circumstances

# Security Properties

Confidentiality

-   Prevent unauthorised disclosure of information
-   Sensitive information should not be leaked to unauthorised parties

Integrity

-   Prevent unauthorised modification of information
-   Critical system state and code cannot be altered by malicious parties

Availability

-   Prevent unauthorised withholding of information or resources
-   The resources should be always available for authorised users

Other properties

-   Accountability: Actions of an entity can be traced and identified
-   Non-repudiation: Unforgeable evidence that specific actions occur

# Security Protection Stages employed by OS

The OS is responsible for protecting the apps running on it

-   The OS controls what users/processes can do

## Authentication

How does a computer know if I am a correct user

-   What you know? Password, PIN, public/private keys
-   What you have? Smartcards, hardware tokens etc.
-   Who you are? Biometrics, face recognition, voice recognition etc.

How does the system conduct authentication?

-   Compare the input credential with the stored one
-   Allow entry when the credential matches

### Hash Function

-   A one-way function f, which takes an input x of arbitrary length, and produces an output f(x) of fixed length
-   Pre-image resistant: Given an input x it is easy to compute f(x), but given an output y, it is hard to find x such that y = f(x)
-   Collision resistant: Computationally infeasible to find a pair (y1, y2) such that y1 != y2 and f(y1) = f(y2)

### Password Storage

-   Hashed passwords
    -   Passwords are hashed and stored in a password table
    -   When a user inputs a password, its hash value is computed and checked against the password table
    -   Hashing passwords prevent attackers from being able to figure out the password even if the password table is hacked into
        -   Dictionary attack
            -   Hashed password, especially human generated passwords are still vulnerable to dictionary attacks
            -   This exploits weaknesses in human-chosen passwords, which tend to derive from words in natural language
            -   Guess some commonly used passwords, compute their hash values and look for the same hash values in the password table
            -   Dictionary attacks are prevented by using password salting
            -   A salt is added to a password before applying the hash function
            -   A salt is a random string
            -   Each password has its own unique salt. Even the same password will have different hash values because they have different salts
            -   The salt value is stored along with the hash of the password + salt
            -   The attacker needs more hash computation to recover the password

### Password Complexity

Set up higher requirements for the password

-   Larger space (lower case, uppercase, numbers, symbols etc)
-   Length
-   No consecutive repeated characters; Not in a dictionary

Pros:

-   Increase difficulty of password guessing attack

Cons:

-   Hard to remember
-   People may try to choose passwords that are easy to remember
-   People may reuse their old passwords
-   People write down their passwords

## Access Control

Security policy

-   Specifies (subject, verb, object) triples
-   Subject = (user, program) pair
-   Verb: action
-   Object: resources

Monitor: Checks whether the action should be allowed

### Access Control Policy

-   Users set access control policies, with some system restrictions
-   Access control list is stored as a sparse matrix (default deny), or as a list
-   Policy is enforced by exposing API to apps, with privileged operations. Checks access control list when API functions are called

## Authorisation

Access control matrix

-   Each column represents an object
-   Each row represents a subject
-   The entry shows the allowed verbs

|       | /etc        | /home       | /usr        |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Alice | Read        | Read        | Read, Write |
| Bob   | Read, Write | Read, Write | Read, Write |
| Carl  | None        | None        | Read        |

### Update Access Matrix

Access control changes

-   Grant capabilities: The owner of the object can grant rights to other users
-   Revoke capabilities: Subjects can revoke the rights from others

Six commands to alter the access matrix `M`

-   Create subject `s`
-   Create object `o`
-   Enter right `r` into cell `Ms, o` (Ms is the subject)
-   Delete right `r` from `Ms, o`
-   Destroy subject `s` (Also deletes column and row for `s` in `M`)
-   Destroy object `o` (Also deletes the column for `o` in `M`)

More representations of access control matrix include

-   Access control list (ACL)
    -   For one object, which subjects has accesses to it? (Check column in access matrix)
-   Capability
    -   For one subject, which objects it has capability to access (check rows in access matrix)
-   Most systems use both
    -   ACLs for opening an object
    -   Capabilities for performation operations

# Data Sharing

Problem: Multiple users want to access the same file/data

-   Give each user corresponding permissions
-   When a new user joins, the permissions have to be granted again
-   When permissions change, need to alter each user

Solution: Group

-   Set permission for the group instead of the user
-   A user joining the group will have the corresponding permissions
-   A user quitting the group will lose the corresponding permissions
-   Easier to manage/update

# Audit Logs

Audit trails:

-   Recording all protection-orientated activites, important to understanding what happened, why, and catching things that should not happen

# Security Threats in OS

## Privilege Rings

Operating modes:

-   Kernel mode has the highest privileges, running critical functions and services
-   Entities with the higher privilege levels cannot call the functions and access objects in the lower privilege levels directly (Syscalls, interrupts, etc.)
-   Status flags allow system to work in different modes (context switching)

## Malware

Software code that maliciously subvert the computer system

-   Virus: Malicious program that causes copies of itself to be created when triggered by the user
-   Worm: Malicious program that causes copies of itself to be created without any user intervention
-   Trojan: Appears to do something useful, however masks some hidden malicious activities
-   Rootkit: Hides other malware from detection and maintains root-level access to the computer
-   Backdoor: Allow a remote part to gain access to the computer
-   Bot: Inserted into a computer and lies dormant until invoked remotely to perform a function
-   Spyware: Inserted into a computer to capture users data
-   Ransomware: Locks up data via encryption, demanding payment to unlock it

## How is Malware Injected?

-   Code injection attack: The system code is not malicious but has bugs allowing executable code to be added or modified
-   Buffer overflow

# Hardware Protection

System layers:

-   Different scenarios may have different layers
-   Lower layers have higher privileges and can protect higher layers
-   Lower layers need to be better protected

Layers:

1. Apps
2. Container
3. OS
4. VM
5. Firmware
6. Hardware

## Chains of Trust

Establish verified systems from bottom to top

-   The bottom layers validate the integrity of the top layers
-   If verification passes, then it is safe to launch
-   Each layer is vulnerable to attack from below if the lower layers are not secured appropriately

## Integrity Verification

Only execute code signed by an entity we tryst

-   Load the bootloader in the firmware
-   Reads and verifies teh kernel
-   Only loads kernel if signature is verified
-   Similarly, kernel can run only verified applications

## Protect Applications from Untrusted OS

Building a secure OS is difficult

-   Large code base size, complex functionalities
-   An untrusted OS can compromise all applications
-   Can we protect the security of apps even if the OS is malicious?

Soultion: Intel Secure Guard Extension (SGX)

-   Security critical code isolated in enclave
-   Only CPU is trusted
-   Memory is encrypted
-   Support remote attestation

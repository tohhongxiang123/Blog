# File Systems

# Structure of File Systems

A file system is generally composed of many different levels

- Logical File System: Manages directory structure, responsible for file creation, access, deletion, protection and security
- File-organisation module: Allocates storage space for files, translates logical block addresses to physical block addresses, and manages free disk space
- Basic file system: Manages buffers and caches, issues generic commands to appropriate device driver to read and write physical blocks on the disk
- IO Control: Consists of device drivers and interrupt handlers to transfer information between memory and disk system

# File Attributes

A file may have the following attributes

- Name: Only information kept in human-readable form
- Identifier: Unique tag that identifies the file within the file system; the non-human-readable name for the file
- Type: Needed for systems that support multiple types of files
- Location: Pointer to file location on device
- Size: Current file size
- Protection: Controls who can read, write or execute the file
- Time, Date, User Identification: Data for protection, security and usage monitoring

These information about files are kept in the directory structure, which is maintained on the disk

## File Types

A file has a contiguous logical address space which can store many different types of information

| File type      | Usual extension                | Function                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Executable     | .exe, .com, .bin, no extension | Ready to run machine-language program                     |
| Object         | .obj, .o                       | Compiled, machine language, not linked                    |
| Source code    | .c, .p, .pas, .asm, .a         | Source code in various languages                          |
| Batch          | .bat, .sh                      | Commands to the command intepreter                        |
| Text           | .tx, .doc                      | Textual data documents                                    |
| Word processor | .wp, .tex, .rrf                | Various word-processor formats                            |
| Library        | .lib, .a                       | Libraries of routines                                     |
| Print or view  | .ps, .dvi, .gif                | ASCII or binary files                                     |
| Archive        | .arc, .zip, .tar               | Related files grouped into one file, sometimes compressed |

## File Structure

A file consists of a collection of records. These records can be organised or structured to facilitate file access

- Unstructured: Sequence of bytes
  - A file is a stream of bytes. Each byte is individually addressable from the beginning of the file
  - Used by UNIX and MSDOS (and assumed in the following discussions)

### File Control Block (FCB) per file

![](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/images/Chapter12/12_02_FileControlBlock.jpg)

FCB contains details about eh ownership, size, permissions, dates etc.

## File Access Methods

- Sequential Access: Information in a file is processed in order from the beginning of the file, one byte after the other
- Direct access: Bytes of a file can be read in a ny order (by referencing byte number)

## File Operations

- Create
  - Allocate disk space. Space must be available for file to be created
  - Create directory entry with file attributes
- Delete
  - Delete the corresponding directory entry
  - Deallocate disk space
- Open
  - Search the directory structure for file entry
  - Move the content to memory (put in the open file table)
  - Information associated with an open file
    - Current position pointer
    - File open count
    - Disk location
- Close
  - Move content of directory entry in memory to directory structure on disk
- Write
  - Search open file table to find the location of the file
  - Write data to position pointed by the Current Position Pointer
- Read
  - Search open file table to find the location of a file
  - Read data from the position pointed to by the current position pointer

## Directory Structure

- A directory typically contains a number of entries, one per file. Both the directory and the files reside on disk
- A directory can be structured in 2 ways
  - Each entry contains a file name and other attributes; or
  - Each entry contains a file name and a pointer to another data structure where file attributes can be found
- A directory can be implemented using:
  1. Linear List
  2. Hash Table

### Linear List

Directory entries are arranged as linear list

- Simple to implement
- Time-consuming to execute: Require linear search to find a particular entry

### Hash Table

**Hash Table**: Directory entries are arranged as linear list with a hash table to facilitate file look-up

- Decreases directory search time
- Collisions: Situations where 2 file names hash to the same location (Solution: Each hash table entry contains a list of directory entries)

## Directory Organisation

Path name

- Absolute path name: Begins at the root and follows a path down the specific file: e.g. `/spell/main/prt/first`
- Relative path name: Defines a path from the current directory
  - E.g. if current directory is `/spell/mail`
  - Relative path name for the above file is `prt/first`

Characteristics

- Efficient searching: File can be easily located according to the path name
- Naming: Files can have the same name under different directories
- Grouping: Files can be grouped logically according to their properties

## Acyclic-Graph Directory

![](https://static.javatpoint.com/operating-system/images/os-acyclic-graph-structured-directories.png)

Support for file sharing with 2 methods

1. Symbolic Link
   - Create a directory entry link, which contains absolute or relative path name of a file
   - Resolve the link by using the path name to locate the real file
   - Slower access than with hard link
2. Hard Link
   - Duplicate all information about a file in multiple directories

### Problems with File Sharing

- In traversing the file system, the shared files may be visited more than once
  - Solution: Ignore the link entry when traversing
- Deleting a shared file may leave dangling pointers to the now non-existent file
  - Solution:
    - Search for dangling links and remove them; or
    - Leave the dangling links and delete them only when they are used again; or
    - Preserve the file until all references to it are deleted

## Directory Operations

- Create
  - Creates a directory
  - In UNIX, 2 entries `.` and `..` are automatically added when a directory is created
  - `.` refers to the current directory
  - `..` refers to the parent directory
- Delete
  - Deletes a directory
  - Only empty directories can be deleted (directory containing only `.` and `..` is considered empty)
- List
  - List all files (directories) and their contents of the directory entry in a directory
- Search
  - Search directory structure to find the entry for a particular file
- Traverse
  - Access every directory and every file within a directory structure

### File System Implementation

![](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/images/Chapter12/12_03_FileSystemStructures.jpg)

There are several key data structures stored in memory

- In memory mount table
- In memory directory cache of recently accessed directory information
- System-wide open file table containing a copy of the FCB for every currently open file int he system, as well as some other related information
- Per-process open file table, containing a pointer to the system open file table as well as some other information (e.g. the current file position pointer may be either here or in the system file table depending on implemnentation and whether the file is being shared or not)

When a new file is created, a new FCB is allocated and filled out with important information regarding the new file. The appropriate diretory is modified with the new file and FCB information

When a new file is accessed during a program, the `open()` system call reads the FCB information from disk and stores it in the system-wide open file table. An entry is added to the per-process open file table referencing the system wide table, and an index into the per-process table is returned by the `open()` system call. UNIX refers to this index as a file descriptor, while windows refers to it as a file handle

If another process already has a file open when a new request comes in for the sam file, and the file is shareable, then a counter in the system-wide table is incremented, and the per-process table is adjusted to point to the existing entry in the system-wide table

When a file is closed, the per-process table entry is freed, and the counter in the system-wide table is decremented. If that counter reaches 0, the system wide table is also freed. Any data currently stored in the memory cache for this file is written out to disk if necessary.

# File Protection in UNIX

- Model of Access: `read`, `write`, `execute`
- 3 classes of users
  - Owner access (7, or RWX), the user who created the file
  - Group access (5, or R-X), a set of users who are sharing the file and need similar access
  - Public access (1, or --X), all other users in the system constitute the universe

| File type | User Access | Group Access | Public Access | Links | UserID | Size | Date  | Time | File name |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----- | ------ | ---- | ----- | ---- | --------- |
| -         | rwx         | r-x          | --x           | 1     | smith  | 58   | Mar 3 | 3:04 | Game1     |

## Permissions for a Directory

- Execute (X)
  - To access a directory, execute permission is essential
  - Without execute permission,
    - Cannot execute any command in the directory
    - No access to any file contained in the file hierarchy rooted at that directory
- Read (R)
  - No read permission -> Cannot list the directory
- Write (W)
  - No write permission -> Cannot create or delete files in the directory

# File Memory Allocation Methods

1. Contiguous allocation
2. Linked allocation
3. Indexed allocation

## Contiguous Allocation

Each file occupies a set of contiguous blocks on the disk

- Simple: Only starting location (block #) and length (number of blocks) are required
- Supports random access

Problems:

- Waste of space (similar to dynamic storage allocation of main memory) because we have to estimate the space of the file before we allocate memory to it
- Finding hole big enough using first-fit (faster) or best-fit may result in external fragmentation
- File space constricted by size of hole, so may later have to move to a bigger hole
- If instead needed file space is overestimated -> Internal fragmentation occurs

Logical to Physical Address Mapping

- Suppose block size is 512 bytes
- Logical address = Q \* 512 + R
- Displacement into block = R
- To get Q, we divide logical address by block size, and get the quotient
- Disk block number = Q + starting disk block number
- For example: If logical address is 2333, and block size is 512, and starting block is 19
  - The block number is 4 and the displacement is 285
  - Physical address will be the 285th byte of the 4 + 19 = 23rd block

## Linked Allocation

Each file is a linked list of disk blocks; Blocks may be scattered anywhere on the disk

- Simple: Need only starting address
- No constraint on file size: Blocks can be allocated as needed
- No waste of space (No external fragmentation)
- However, random access not supported

Logical to Physical Address Mapping

- Suppose block size is 512 bytes, and the first 4 bytes is reserved for the pointer to the next block in the list
- Logical address = Q \* 508 + R
- Block to be accessed is the Qth block (zero-indexed) in the linked chain of blocks representing the file
- Displacement into the block = R + 4

For example:

We want to look for the file `jeep` which starts at block 9, ends at block 25, and has the following linked allocation chain

```
9 -> 16 -> 1 -> 10 -> 25 -> -1
```

25 is the end of the chain, since it points to -1. If we are given logical address 2333, we know that 2333 = 4\*508 + 301. So we go into block 25 (zero-indexed 4th block), with a displacement of 301 + 4.

## Indexed Allocation

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/indexedAllocation.jpg)

Each file has an index block which contains all pointers to the allocated blocks. Directory entry contains the block number of the index block

- Supports random access
- Dynamic storage allocation without external fragmentation (similar to the allocation of main memory using paging scheme)
- Problem: Overhead of keeping index blocks and address mapping

Logical to Physical Address Mapping

- Suppose maximum file size is 128KB, and block size is 512B
- 2 blocks are needed for index table (4 bytes are used for each pointer, 128KB/512B = 256 pointers. Since each pointer is 4B, 256\*4 = 1024B = 2 blocks)
- Logical address = Q\*512 + R
- Displacement into index table: Q (zero-indexed)
- Displacement into block = R

For example, consider the indexed allocation table as follows

| Points To |
| --------- |
| 9         |
| 16        |
| 1         |
| 10        |
| 25        |
| -1        |
| -1        |
| -1        |

Logical address 2333 = 4\*512 + 285. The 4th block points to block 25 (zero-indexed)

Hence the physical address is at the 285th byte of block 25

### UNIX inode

![UNIX Inode](https://i.stack.imgur.com/G4fao.gif)

- For each file or directory, there is an inode (index block)
- The inode contains
  - File attributes
  - 12 pointers point to direct blocks (data blocks)
  - 3 pointers point to indirect blocks (index blocks). They are
    - Single indirect (1 pointer to the data block)
    - Double indirect (Pointer points to another pointer, which points to the data block)
    - Triple indirect (3 pointer chain before reaching data block)

Assuming 4B block pointer and 4K bytes block. The maximum file size supported by an inode is:

- By direct pointers: 12 \* 4K = 48KB
- Direct + Single pointers = 48KB + 2^22 B (4KB / 4B = 2^10 pointers. Each pointer points to a 4KB block, hence 2^10 _ 4 _ 2^10 = 2^22)
- Direct + Single pointers + Double pointers = 48KB + 2^22 B + 2^32 B (2^10 pointers in level 1, each pointer points to another 2^10 pointers, each pointer points to a 4KB block. 2^10 _ 2^10 _ 4K = 2^32 B = 4GB)

Each directory entry in UNIX contains an inode number and a file name

- Each inode has a fixed location in disk
- File look-up is straightforward. For example, looking up `usr/ast/mbox`
  - From the root inode, check where the pointer for `usr` points to (6)
  - Go to the block pointed to by the pointer. This is the `usr` directory. Repeat again for `ast` and `mbox`

## Disk-Space Management

Block size affects both data rate and disk space utilisation

- Big block size: File fits into few blocks -> Fast to find and transfer blocks, however wastes space if file does not occupt the entire last block
- Small block size: File may consist of many blocks -> Slow data rate

Block size is a trade-off between time and space utilisation, and has to be compromised

Keeping track of free blocks

- Similar to the issue of keeping track of memory usage in memory management under variable partition multiprogramming. Methods include
  - Bit map or Bit vector
  - Linked List

### Bit Map or Bit Vector

![Bit map for memory management](https://examradar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Memory-Management-with-Bitmap.png)

- Each block is represented by 1 bit
  - 0 if block is free, 1 if block is allocated
- Bit map requires extra space
  - E.g. block size = 2^9 bytes
  - Disk size = 2^34 bytes
  - Required entries = 2^34 / 2^9 = 2^25 entries
  - Bit map size = 2^25 entries / 8 bits per byte = 2^22 bytes
- Bit map is usually kept in a fixed place on disk. May be brought into memory for efficiency - needs to write back to disk occassionally for consistency and security
- Easy to locate free blocks, but inefficiency unless the entire map is kept in memory

### Linked List

![Linked list free space management](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/2-190.png)

- Link together all the free disk blocks, keeping a pointer to the first free block in a special location on the disk and caching it in memory
- No extra space required, however not efficient

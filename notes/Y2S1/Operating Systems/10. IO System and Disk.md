# IO System and Disk

# IO System Design Objectives

-   Efficiency
    -   Important because IO operations often form a bottleneck
    -   Most IO devices are extremely slow compared with main memory and processor
-   Generality
    -   Desriable to handle all devices in a uniform manner
    -   Applies to the way processes view IO devices, and the way the operating system manages IO devices and operations

# Kernel IO Subsystem

-   The kernel is the core part of an OS that manages system resources
-   It acts as a bridge between application and hardware of the computer
-   The kernel provides many services related to IO
    -   IO Scheduling
    -   Buffering
    -   Caching
    -   Spooling
    -   Error handling etc

## IO Scheduling

-   Schedule IO requests through rearranging the order of services (eg. disk scheduling)
-   Can improve system efficiency

## Buffering

-   Store data in memory while transferring between devices
-   Cope with device speed mismatch
-   Cope with device transfer size mismatch (e.g. in networking)

## Caching

-   Fast memory holding copy of data
-   To improve IO efficiency for files that are being written and reread rapidly

## Spooling

-   Hold output for a device
-   Used in device that can serve only one request at a time (e.g. printing)

# Double Buffering

![Double buffering](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200430160107/Untitled-Diagram-5-1-11.png)

-   A device that has 2 buffers can double buffer
-   Usage of multiple buffers increase overall throughput of a device, helps prevent bottlenecks
-   E.g. with double buffering, a graphics device can show one frame, while loading another frame at the same time

# How the OS Interacts with Devices

1. Request IO
2. System call, trap to kernel mode
3. Kernel IO checks if IO request can be satisfied
    1. If yes, place data in return values or in process space, and return from system call
4. Send request to device driver, block process if appropriate
5. Device driver processes request, issues commands to the controller, configure controller to block until interrupt
6. The device controller, when ready, executes command, and monitors device
7. IO operation complete, generate interrupt
8. Interrupt handler receives the interrupt, stores data in device-driver buffer if input, signals to unblock device driver
9. Device driver which IO completed, indicate state changes to the IO subsystem
10. Return from system call
11. IO complete, input data available or output completed

# Performance Considerations

-   IO is a major factor in system performance
-   It demands CPU to execute device driver code
-   Context swithcing due to interrupts may stress CPU
-   Data copying between IO controllers and physical memory also affects system performance

# Disk

![Disk structure](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/images/Chapter10/10_01_DiskMechanism.jpg)

-   Disk drives are addressed as large 1-D arrays of physical blocks, where the physical block is the smallest unit of transfer (usually 512 bytes)
-   The array of physical blocks is mapped to the sectors of the disk sequentially
-   To read a requested sector, disk drive needs to position the disk head and perform data transfer
-   The time taken to position the head has 2 major components
    1. Seek time: For moving the head to the track containing the desired sector
    2. Rotational latency: For the disk to rotate the desired sector to the disk head
        - Note that rotational latency is half the time required for the disk to make one full rotation
-   If reading multiple tracks, the time taken is number of tracks \* (positioning time per track)

## Disk Scheduling

-   The OS is responsible for using hardware efficiently - for disk drives this means having fast access times and high disk bandwidth
-   We aim to minimise seek time
-   To minimise seek time, we should minimise seek distance
-   Disk bandwidth is the total number of bytes transferred, divided by the total time between the 1st request and the completion of the last transfer
-   Several disk-scheduling algorithms exist to schedule the servicing of disk IO requests

Consider the following request queue (0-199) and assume that the head is initially at cylinder 53

-   98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67

### FCFS

![FCFS Disk scheduling](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190727015526/fcfs-1.jpg)

-   First request in the queue is handled first
-   Total seek distance = 98 - 53 + 183 - 98 + 183 - 37 + ... + 67 - 65 = 640
-   Disadvantage: FCFS may have **wild swings back and forth**

### Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)

![SSTF Disk scheduling](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/3333-4.png)

-   Selects the request with the minimum seek time from the current head position
-   SSTF scheduling is a form of shortest job first scheduling; May have **starvation** under heavy load, since distant requests may never be serviced

### SCAN

![SCAN Disk scheduling](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190727175932/fcfs-2.jpg)

-   Disk arm starts at one end of the disk, and moves towards the other end, servicing requests until it gets to the other end of the disk, where the head movement is reversed, and servicing continues

### Circular Scan

-   Similar to scan, head moves from low end to high end of disk, servicing requests along the way
-   However, when reaching the high end, head immediately returns to the beginning of the disk without servicing any requests

### C-LOOK

-   Similar to C-SCAN
-   Head moves from low end to high end of disk, servicing requests along
-   When reaching the last request, head returns immediately to the lowest cylinder number request
-   From there it services the requests towards teh high end of the disk

### Selecting a Disk Scheduling Algorithm

-   SSTF is common and has a natural appeal
-   SCAN and CSCAN (or LOOK and CLOOK) perform better for systems taht place a heavy load on the disk (since starvation is unlikely)
-   Performance depends on the number and types of requests
-   Requests for disk service can be influenced by the file-allocation method
    -   A program reading a contiguously allocated file will generate requests that are close together
    -   A linked/indexed file may generate request that are widely apart, resulting in greater head movement

## Disk Management

-   Low-level formatting (physical formatting): Dividing disk into sectors tat the disk controller can read/write
-   To use a disk to hold files, the OS needs to record its own data structures on the disk
-   2 steps:
    1. Partition the disk into one or more groups of cylinders
    2. Logical formatting or "making a file system"

## Disk Reliabilitiy

-   Several improvements in disk-use techniques involve multiple disks working cooperatively
-   Disk striping: Use a group of disks as a storage unit
    -   Each block broken into several subblocks, with one sub-block stored on each disk
    -   Time to transfer a block into memory is faster because all subblocks transferred in parallel
-   Mirroring keeps a duplicate of each disk
    -   A logical disk consists of 2 physical disks
    -   If one fails, teh data can be read from the other

RAID (Redundant array of independent disks) improves performance and reliability of disk storage system by storing redundant data

-   RAID 0: non-redundant striping
-   RAID 1: mirroring, keeps duplicate of each disk
-   RAID 0 + 1: Mirror of strip or RAID 1 + 0: Strip of mirrors, provides high performance and high reliability

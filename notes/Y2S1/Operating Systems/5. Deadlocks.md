# Deadlocks

A deadlock is a set of blocked processes each holding a resource and waiting to acquire a resource held by another process in the set

For example, consider the following 2 processes P0 and P1, with semaphores A and B

P0:

```
wait(A);
wait(B);
// do something
signal(B);
signal(A);
```

P1:

```
wait(B);
wait(A);
// do something else
signal(A);
signal(B);
```

Consider the following sequence of events taking place

1. P0 starts first, and executes `wait(A)` successfully
2. Context switch occurs to P1, and `wait(B)` successfully executes
3. Context switch occurs and P0 is now currently waiting on `B`. However, P1 is currently holding semaphore `B` and is waiting for `A`, while P0 is holding `A` and is waiting for `B`. Both processes are waiting for each other to complete before they can continue. This is a deadlock.

# System Model

-   Consider resource types $R_1, R_2, ..., R_m$
    -   Memory space, IO devices, semaphores etc
-   Each resource type $R_i$ has $W_i$ identical instances
-   Each process utilises a resource as follows:
    1. Request for a specific number of instances
    2. Use the instances
    3. Release all the instances

## Resource Allocation Graph

Consider the graph $G = (V, E)$

-   $V$ is partitioned into 2 types
    1. $P = \{P_1, P_2, ..., P_n\}$, the set consisting of all the processes in the system
    2. $R = \{R_1, R_2, ..., R_m\}$, the set consisting of all resource types in the system
-   $E$ is partitioned into 2 types
    1. Request edge: Directed edge $P_i \to R_j$
        - This edge is added when a process $P_i$ requests for resource $R_j$
        - When the request is granted, this edge is removed
    2. Assignment edge: Directed edge $R_j \to P_i$
        - This edge is added when a resource $R_j$ is assigned to $P_i$
        - When the resource is released, this edge is removed

### Resource Allocation Graph without Deadlock

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Presentation1-1.jpg)

Over here, we can see that $P_1$ and $P_2$ have to complete execution first, since they are using $R_1$ and $R_2$ respectively. Only once both of them complete, $P_3$ can continue execution, and finish.

### Resource Allocation Graph with Deadlock

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Slide1.jpg)

Over here, $P_1$ is currently using $R_1$ and is waiting for $R_2$, while $P_2$ is currently using $R_2$ and is waiting for $R_1$. For $P_1$ to continue execution, $P_2$ must release $R_2$ first. However, for $P_2$ to continue exeuction, $P_1$ must release $R_1$ first.

Since both of the processes are waiting upon each other, and no progress can be made, this is a deadlock.

Note that, not all graphs with cycles means that there is a deadlock. Consider the following resource allocation graph below:

![](https://www.gatevidyalay.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Example-of-Resource-Allocation-Graph.png)

If $P_3$ finishes execution, $P_2$ can execute, and then finally $P_1$.

## Basic Facts

-   If graph contains no cycles -> No deadlock
-   If graph contains a cycle
    -   If only one instance per resource type, then deadlock
    -   If several instances per resource type, then possiblity of deadlock

# Deadlock Conditions

Deadlock may arise if the following 4 conditions hold simultaneously

1. Mutual Exclusion: Only 1 process at a time can use a resource instance
2. Hold and wait: A process holding at least one resouce is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes
3. No preemption: A resource can be released only voluntarily by the process holding it, after that process has completed its task
4. Circular wait: There exists a set $\{P_0, P_1, ..., P_n\}$ of waiting processes such that $P_0$ is waiting for a resource that is held by $P_1$, $P_1$ is waiting for a resouce held by $P_2$, ..., $P_{n-1}$ is waiting for a resource held by $P_n$, and $P_n$ is waiting for a resource held by $P_1$.

# Handling Deadlocks

There are multiple ways to handle deadlock

-   Ensure that system will never enter a deadlock state
-   Allow the system to enter a deadlock state and then recover
-   Ignore the problem and pretend that deadlocks never occur in the system
    -   Used by most operating systems, including UNIX

## Deadlock Prevention

To prevent deadlocks, we must prevent at least 1 of the 4 deadlock conditions

Recall the dining-philosopher solution using semaphores

-   Each chopstick is a shared resourdce protected by a binary semaphore (`chopstick[5]`)
-   Initially for all i, `chopstick[i] = 1`
-   For each philosopher

```c
while (1) {
    wait(chopstick[i]);
    wait(chopstick[(i + 1) % 5]);

    eat();

    signal(chopstick[i]);
    signal(chopstick[(i + 1) % 5]);

    think();
}
```

1. Mutual exclusion
    - Chopsticks are not shareable simultaneously, hence this condition cannot be eliminated
2. Hold and wait
    - Must guarantee that whenever a process requests a resource, it does not hold up any other resource
    - Allow a philosopher to pick up chopsticks only if both the required chopsticks are available
3. No preemption
    - If a philosopher cannot get the second chopstick, then preempt and release the chopstick that is being held
4. Circular wait
    - Allow at most 4 philosophers to be hungry simultaneously
    - Odd-even solution
    - Chopsticks can only be acquired in order

## Deadlock Avoidance

The deadlock-avoidance algorithm dynamically examines the resource-allocation state to ensure that the system never goes into an unsafe state

-   When a proces requests an available resource, the system must decide if immediate allocation leaves the system in a "safe" state
-   If safe, the request is granted, else, the process must wait

System is in safe stae if **there exists a safe completion sequence of all processes without deadlock**

### Safe State

A process completion sequence $<P_1, P_2, ..., P_n>$ is safe, if for each $P_i$, the resources that $P_i$ requests can be satisfied by currently available resources + resources held by all the $P_j, j < i$

-   If $P_i$'s needs cannot be immediately met, then $P_i$ can wait until all $P_j, j < i$ have finished
-   When all $P_j, j < i$ are finished, $P_i$ can obtain needed resources, execute, return allocated resources, and terminate
-   When $P_i$ terminates, $P_{i+1}$ can obtain its resources, and so on
-   All processes in the sequence can finish

For example,

| Process | Hold | Request |
| ------- | ---- | ------- |
| 1       | 1    | 1       |
| 2       | 1    | 2       |
| 3       | 1    | 3       |

There is only 1 instance available here.

P1 is holding 1 resource, and requesting for 1 more. P2 is holding 1 resource, and is requesting for 2 more. P3 is holding 1 resource, and is requesting for 3 more.

Is `<P1, P2, P3>` safe?

-   P1.request <= available
    -   There is currently 1 available resource instance, and this means that P1.request can be satisfied
-   P2.request <= P1.hold + available
    -   After P1 finishes, it releases the resource it is holding onto. Now, there are 1 + 1 = 2 resource instances available for P2. And since P2.request <= resources available, P2 is able to complete
-   P3.request <= P1.hold + P2.hold + available
    -   After both P1 and P2 finish, they release both their held resource. Hence the total available resource instances is 1 + 2 = 3, which means that P3's requests can be satisfied

Since all the processes can complete, it is safe

Is `<P3, P2, P1>` safe?

-   P3.request > available
    -   There is currently 1 available resource. P3 is requesting for 3 resources. Since there are less resources available than what P3 is requesting for, this sequence here is unsafe

Hence, this is not a safe state

Is the system safe?

-   Yes, since there exists at least 1 safe sequence `<P1, P2, P3>`

# Safe, Unsafe, and Deadlock States

-   If a system is in a safe state, there is no deadlock
-   If a system is in an unsafe state, there is a possibility of deadlock
    -   If a process releases resources much before its completion, then deadlock may not occur
-   Deadlock Avoidance
    -   Ensure that a system will never enter an unsafe state

# Banker's Algorithm

An algorithm to check whether satisfaction of a resource request would lead to an unsafe state

-   For multiple instances of each resource type

When a process requests a resrouce, it may have to wait if the allocation leads to an unsafe state

Assumptions

-   Each process must declare the maximum instances of each resource type that it needs
-   When a process gets all its resources it must return them in a finite amount of time

## Data Structures for Banker's Algorithm

-   `n` - number of processes
-   `m` - number of resource types
-   `int[m] available` - If `available[j] == k`, there are `k` instances of resource type `Rj` available
-   `int[m][n] max` - If `max[i][j] == k`, then process `Pi` may request at most `k` instances of resource type `Rj`
-   `int allocation[n][m]` - If `allocation[i][j] == k`, then process `Pi` is currently allocated `k` instances of `Rj`
-   `int[n][m] need` - If `need[i][j] == k`, the process `Pi` may need `k` more instances of `Rj` to complete the task

```
need[i][j] = max[i][j] - allocation[i][j]
```

## Banker's Algorithm Part 1 - Safety Algorithm

1. Let `work` and `finish` be vectors of length `m` and `n` respectively. Initially

```
work = available;
finish[i] = [false, false, ..., false]; // false for i = 0 to n-1
```

2. Finding processes that are not finished, but can be allocated their required resources. Find an `i` such that
    - `finish[i] == false` and
    - `need[i][*] <= work` (Every entry within the `need[i]` vector must be less than the corresponding entry in `work`)

If no such `i` exists, go to step 4

3. After a process completes, free up the resources that were used.

```
work = work + allocation[i][*];
finish[i] = true
```

Then go back to step 2

4. If `finish[i] == true` for all `i`, then the system is in a safe state, else it is unsafe

## Banker's Algorithm Part 2 - Resource-Request Algorithm

-   `request[i]` = request vector for process `Pi`
    -   If `request[i][j] == k`, then process `Pi` wants `k` instances of resource type `Rj`

1. If `request[i] <= need[i]` for all entries, then go to step 2
    - Otherwise, raise an error condition, since process has requestd for more resources than it needs
2. If `request[i] <= available` for all entries,then go to step 3
    - Otherwise, there are not enough resources available for `Pi`, and the process must wait
3. Pretend to allocate requested resources to `Pi` by modifying the state as follows

```
available = available - request; // since Pi is request, subtract from available
allocation[i] = allocation[i] + request[i]; // add allocated resources
need[i] = need[i] - request[i]; // subtract since fulfilled requests
```

4. Run the safety algorithm
    - Safe: The resources are allocated to `Pi`
    - Unsafe: `Pi` must wait, and the old resource-allocation state is restored

# Deadlock Detection

-   Allow system to enter a deadlock state
-   Then invoke detection algorithms
    -   For single instance of each resource type (Identifying cycles in a resource-allocation graph)
    -   For multiple instances of each resource type (Explained further below)
-   Then invoke recovery algorithm (not shown here)

## Multiple Instances of Each Resource Type

-   `available` - a vector of length `m` indicating the number of available resource types
-   `allocation` - an `n x m` matrix defining the number of resources of each type currently allocated to each process
-   `request` - an `n x m` matrix indicating the current requests of each process. If `request[i][j] = k`, then process `Pi` is requesting `k` more instances of resource type `Rj`

## Detection Algorithm

1. Let `work` and `finish` be vectors of length `m` and `n` respectively. Initially,

```
work = available;
finish = [false if allocation[i] != 0 else true for i in range(n)];
```

For `finish`, set `finish[i]` to `false` if there are more than 0 resources allocated to process `Pi`. If there are 0 resources allocated to `Pi`, this means that `Pi` has finished executing

2. Find an `i` such that `finish[i] == false` and `request[i][*] <= work`

    - If no such `i` exists, go to step 4

3. `work = work + allocation[i][*]; finish[i] = true`, and then go to step 2
4. If `finish[i] == false` for some `i`, then the system (process `Pi`) is deadlocked

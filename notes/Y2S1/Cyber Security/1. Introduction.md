# Introduction

# What is Information Security?

> Information security is defending information from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction

# History of Information Security

-   Computer security began immediately after the first **mainframes** were developed
    -   At their core, mainframes are high-performance computers with large amounts of memory and processors that process billions of simple calculations and transactions in real time. The mainframe is critical to commercial databases, transaction servers, and applications that require high resiliency, security, and agility.
    -   **Physical security** to defend mainframes from being attacked or sabotaged from people
    -   Groups developing code-breaking computations during WWII created the first modern computers
    -   Multiple levels of security were implemented to protect mainframes
-   Physical controls limiting access to sensitive military locations to authorised personnel
-   Rudimentary in defending against physical theft, espionage and sabotage

## Enigma Machine

The Enigma machine is a cipher device developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic, and military communication. It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II, in all branches of the German military.

The Germans believed, erroneously, that use of the Enigma machine enabled them to communicate securely and thus enjoy a huge advantage in World War II. The Enigma machine was considered to be so secure that even the most top-secret messages were enciphered on its electrical circuits.

However, Allied forces were able to crack the code used by the Enigma, and information gained from the decrypted transmissions allowed the Allied forces to win the war.

## The 1960s

-   Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) began to examine feasibility of **redundant networked communications**
    -   Network redundancy is the process of **adding additional instances of network devices** and lines of communication to help **ensure network availability** and **decrease the risk of failure** along the critical data path.
-   Larry Roberts, founder of the Internet, developed the ARPANET

## The 1970s and 1980s

-   ARPANET grew in popularity, so did the potential for abuse
-   Fundamental problems with ARPANET
    -   No safety procedures for dial-up connections to ARPANET
    -   Nonexistent user identification and authorisation to system
-   Late 1970s, microprocessors expanded computing capabilities and security threats
-   The Rand Report R609 paper started the study of computer security and identified the roleof mangement and policy issues in it
-   Scope of computer security grew from physical security to include
    1. Securing data
    2. Limiting random and unauthorised access to data
    3. Involving personnel from multiple levels from the organisation in information security

## MULTICS

-   Early research focus - Multiplexed Information and Computing Service (MULTICS)
-   First operating system was created with security integrated into core functions
-   Mainframe, time-sharing OS developed in mid-1960s by General Electric, Bell Labs, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
-   Several MULTICS key players created UNIX
    -   Primary purpose of UNIX was text processing

## The 1990s

-   Networks of computers became prevalent in response to the need to connect them to one another
-   Internet became the first global network of computers
-   In early Internet deployments, security was treated wiht low priority

## 2000s to Present

-   Internet brings millions of computer networks into communication with each other, many of them unsecured
-   The security of data in a computer was affected by the security of every computer its affected to
-   Growing threat of cyber attack
    -   Increased the awareness for the need to improve security
    -   Nation-states engaging in information warfare

# Components of an Information System

-   Information system (IS) is an entire set of components necessary to use information as a resource in the organisation
    -   Software
    -   Hardware
    -   Data
    -   People
    -   Procedures
    -   Networks

# What is Security?

> Security is the **protection of information** and its critical elements, including systems and hardware that **use**, **store** and **transmit** that information

-   Security covers information security management, data security and network security

# CIA Triangle (Tested)

-   A standard based on **Confidentiality**, **Integrity** and **Availablility**, now viewed as inadequate
-   Expanded model consists of a list of critical characteristics of information

> The protection afforded to an automated information system connected to internet in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the **CONFIDENTIALITY**, **INTEGRITY** and **AVAILABILITY** of the **information system resources**

# Critical Characteristics of Information

-   Availability - users who need to access information can do so without interference
-   Accuracy - information is free from errors
-   Authenticity - quality of being genuine
-   Confidentiality - prevent disclosure to unauthorised personnel
-   Integrity - quality of being whole
-   Utility - quality of having value for some purpose
-   Possesion - attribute that describes who has ownership of the information

# Key Information Security Concepts

-   Access
-   Asset
-   Attack
-   Control, safeguard, countermeasure
-   Exploit
-   Exposure
-   Loss
-   Protection profile or security posture
-   Risk
-   Subjects and objects
-   Threat
-   Threat agent
-   Vulnerability

-   A computer can be the subject or the object of an attack
    -   Computer can be used to attack (subject of the attack)
    -   Computer can be attacked as well (object of an attack)

# Threats and Attacks

Can be:

-   Intentional (by hackers)
-   Unintentional (Lightning strikes)

-   Passive (Snooping/eavesdropping/traffic analysis)
-   Active (Modification, masquerading, replaying or repudiation)

-   Direct (by hacker pc)
-   Indirect (via compromised computers, e.g. Distributed Denial of Service)

## Threats to Confidentiality

-   Snooping (Stealing information transmitted over a network)
-   Traffic Analysis (Analysis of information transmitted over a network)

## Threats to Integrity

-   Modification (Directly modify data)
-   Masquerading (Pretend to be someone else)
-   Replaying (Eavesdrops on a secure network communication, intercepts it, and then fraudulently delays or resends it to misdirect the receiver into doing what the hacker wants)
-   Repudiation (When an application or system does not adopt controls to properly track and log users' actions, thus permitting malicious manipulation or forging the identification of new actions)

## Threats to Availability

-   Denial of service (An attack meant to shut down a machine or network)

## Snooping/eavesdropping

-   Interception of information intended for someone else during its transmission over a communication channel

## Traffic Analysis

-   Observe patterns of messages

## Aleration or Modification

-   Unauthorised modification of information
-   E.g. Man-in-the-middle attack, where a network stream is intercepted, modified and retransmitted

## Replaying

-   Capture message and then replay later

## Repudiation

-   The denial of a commitment or data receipt
-   When an application or system does not adopt controls to properly track and log users' actions, thus permitting malicious manipulation or forging the identification of new actions
-   Attack can be used to change authoring information of actions executed by a malicious user in order to log wrong data to log files
-   Repudiate = deny
-   Non-repudiation is the assurance that someone cannot deny something - refers to the ability to ensure that a party to a contract or a communication cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or sending of a message that they originated

## Denial of Service

-   Interruption or degradation of a data service or information access
-   E.g. email spam to a degree that it is meant to simply fill up a mail queue, and slow down an email server

## Distributed Denial of Service

-   Dozens or even hundreds of computers are compromised, loaded with DoS attack software then remotely activated by the hacker to conduct a coordinated attack
-   Basically hundreds of computers will flood a server with requests, causing the server to overload

# Tools, Firewalls and VPNs

-   Tools and technology are essential in enforcing policy for many IT functions not under direct human control
-   When properly implemented, technical solutions improve an organisation's ability to balance the objectives of making information readily available and preserving information's confidentiality and integrity

# Cyber Secrity Services

-   Authentication: Assurance that communicating entity is the one claimed
-   Access Control: Prevention of the unauthorised use of online resource
-   Data Confidentiality: Protection of data from unauthorised disclosure
-   Data Integrity: Assurance that data received is as sent by an authorized entity
-   Non-repudiation: Protection against denial by one of the parties in a communication
-   Availibility: Resource accessible/usable
-   Security Mechanism: Feature designed to detect, prevetnt or recover from a security attack

# Tools for Confidentiality

## Encryption

The transformation of information using a secret (encryption) key so that the transformed infomation can only be read using another secret (decryption key) which may, in some cases, be the same as the encryption key

Plaintext M -> CipherText C -> Plaintext M'

## Access Control

Rules and policies that limit access to confidential information to those people and systems with a "need to known" basis

This need to know may be determined by identity, such as a person's name or a computer's serial number, or by a role a person has, such as being an administrator or computer security specialist

## Authentication

The determinatino of the identity/role that someone has

This determinatino can be done in multiple ways, but usually it is a combination of

-   Something the person has (a smart card)
-   Something the person knows (a password)
-   Something the person is (a human with a fingerprint)

## Authorisation

The determination if a person or system is allowed access to resources, based on an access control policy

Such authorisations should prevent an attacker from tricking the system into letting him have access to protected resources

## Physical Security

The establishment of physical barriers to limit access to protected coputational resources

Such barriers include

-   Locks on cabinets and doors
-   Placement of computers in windowless rooms
-   Use of sound dampening materials

# Tools for Integrity

Integrity: The property that information has not been altered in an unauthorised way

## Tools

-   Backups: The periodic archiving of data
-   Checksums: The computation of a function that maps the contents of a file to a numerical value
    -   Checksums are designed in such a way that a small change to the input file is highly likely to result in a different output value
-   Data correcting codes: Methods for storing data in such a way that small changes can be easily detected and automatically correctes

# Tools for Availability

Availability: The property that information is accessible and modifiable in a timely fashion by those authorised to do so

## Tools

-   Physical protection: Infrastructure meant to keep information available even in the event of physical challenges
-   Computational redundancies: Coputers and storage devices that serve as fallbacks in the case of failures

# Attacks, Mechanisms and Services

Security Attack

-   Any action that compromises the security of information

Security Mechanism

-   A mechanism that is designed to detect, prevent or recover from a security attack

Security Service

-   A service that enhances the security of data processing systems and infromation transfers. A security service makes use of one ormore security mechanisms

# Access Control

-   Method by which systems determine whether and how to admit a user into a trusted area of the organisation
-   Discretionary access controls (DACs): allow users to control and possibly provide access to information or resources at their disposal
-   Nondiscretionary controls: Stricly enforced version of MACs that are managed by a central authority
    -   E.g. mandatory access controls or role-based/tasked-based access control
-   Mandatory access controls (MACs): use data classification schemes

# Identification

-   Mechanism whereby unverified entities seeking access to a resource (supplicants) provide a label by which they are known to the system
-   Identifiers can be composite identifiers, concatenating elements - department codes, random numbers, special characters - to make them unique
-   Some organisations generate random numbers

# Authentication

-   The process of validating a user purported identity
-   Authentication factors include
    -   Something a user knows
        -   Password: A private word/combination of characters that only the user should know
        -   Passphrase: A series of characters, typically longer than a password, from which a virtual password is derived

## Password Security

-   Never install any application or service with default passwords frmo the vendor
-   Make the passwords at least 10 characters long
-   Use numbers/letters/symbols
-   Avoid using actual words
-   Avoid names, social security numbers, etc.
-   Change passwords at least once every 4 months
-   Memorize passwords and keep them secret

-   More authentication factors
    -   Something a user has
        -   Dumb card: ID/ATM card with magnetic stripe
        -   Smart card: Contains a computer chip that can verify and validate information
        -   Synchronous tokens
        -   Asynchronous tokens
    -   Something a user is
        -   Relies upon individual characteristics
        -   Strong authentication

# Authorisation

-   The matching of an authenticated entity to a list of information assets and corresponding access levels
-   Authorisation can be handled in one of 3 ways
    1. Authorisation for each authenticated user
    2. Authorisation for members of a group
    3. Authorisation across multiple systems
-   Authorisation tickets

# Accountability

-   Ensures that all actions on a system - authorised or unauthorised - can be attributed to an authenticated identity
-   Most often accomplished by means of system logs and database journals, and teh auditing of these records
-   Sysetms logs record specific information
-   Logs have many uses

# Biometrics

-   Approach based on the use of measurable human characteristics/traits to authenticate identity
-   Only fingerprints, the retina of an eye and the iris of an eye are considered truly unique
-   Evaluated on false reject rate, false accept rate, and crossover error rate
-   Highly reliable/effective biometric systems are often considered intrusive by users

# Firewalls

-   Prevent specific types of information from moving between an unrtrusted network (the Internet) and a trusted network (organisation's internal network)
-   May be
    -   Separate computer system
    -   Software service running on existing router or server
    -   Separate network containing supporting devices

## Firewall Processing Modes

Five processing modes by which firewalls can be categorised

1. Packet filtering
2. Application gateways
3. Circuit gateways
4. MAC layer firewalls
5. Hybrids

### Packet Filtering Firewalls

-   Examine the header information of data packets
-   Most often based on the combination of
    -   IP source and destination
    -   Direction (inbound or outbound)
    -   Transmission control protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and destination port requests
-   Simple firewall models enforce rules designed to prohibit packets with certain addresses or partial addresses from passin gthrough device
-   Three subsets of packet-filtering firewalls
    1. Static filtering: Requires that filtering rules be developed and installed within the firewall
    2. Dynamic filtering: Allows firewall to react to emergent event and update or create rules to deal with events
    3. Stateful packet inspection (SPI): Firewalls that keep track of each network connection between the internal and external systems using a state table

### Application Layer Firewall

-   Frequently installed on a dedicated computer; also known as a proxy server
-   Since a proxy server is often placed in unsecured areas of the network (eg DMZ), it is exposed to higher levels of risk from less trusted networks
-   Additional filtering routers can be implemented behind the proxy server, further protecting internal systems

Untrusted Networks -> Application Layer (Proxy) -> Internal System

### MAC Layer Firewalls

-   Designed to operate at media access control sublayer of network's data link layer
-   Make filtering decisions based on a specific host computer's identity
-   MAC addresses of specific host coputers are linked to access control list (ACL) entires that identify specific types of packets that can be sent to each host; all other traffic is blocked

### Hybrid Firewalls

-   Combine elements of multiple other types of firewalls into a single firewall
-   ALternately, may consist of 2 separate firewall devices, each a separate firewall system, but connected to work in tandem
-   Enables an organisation to make security improvement without completely replacing existing firewalls

## Firewall Architectures

-   Firewall devices can be configured in several network connectino architectures
-   Best configuration depends on 3 factors
    1. Objective of network
    2. Organisation's ability to develop and implement architectures
    3. Budget available for function
-   4 common architectural implementations of firewalls
    1. Packet-filtering routers
    2. Dual-homed firewalls (bastion hosts)
    3. Screened host firewalls
    4. Screened subnet firewalls

### Packet-filtering Routers

-   Most organisations with internet connection have a router at the boundary between internal networks and external service providers
-   Many of these routers can be configured to reject packets that the organisation does not allow into its networks
-   Drawbacks include lack of auditing and strong authentication

### Dual-homed Firewalls (Bastion Hosts)

![Dual homed firewalls diagram](https://img.brainkart.com/extra/RRBQwaF.jpg)

-   Commonly referred to as a sacrifical host, as it stands as the sole defender on the network perimeter
-   Contains 2 network interface cards (NICs)
    -   One is connected to the external network
    -   One connected to internal network
-   Implementation of this architecture often makes use of network address translation (NAT), creating another barrier to intrusion from external attackers

### Screened Hosts Firewalls

-   Combines packet-filtering router with separate dedicated firewall such as an application proxy server
-   Allows router to prescreen packets to minimise traffic on internal proxy
-   Requires external attack to compromise 2 separate systems before attack can access internal data

### Screened Subnet Firewall with DMZ

![](https://slideplayer.com/slide/4789146/15/images/49/Screened-Subnet+Firewalls%28contd%29.jpg)

-   The dominant architecture used today
-   Commonly consists of 2 or more internal bastion hosts behind packet-filtering router, with each host protecting a trusted network
    -   Connections from outside or untrusted networks are routed through external filtering router
    -   Connections from outside or untrusted network are tehn routed into and out of routing firewall to separate the network segment known as the DMZ
    -   Connections into trusted internal networks are allowed only frmo DMZ bastion host servers
-   Screened subnet performs 2 functions
    1. Protects DMZ systems and information from outside threats
    2. Protects internal networks by limiting how external connections can gain access to internal systems
-   ANother facet of DMZs: Extranets

## Configuring and Managing Firewalls

-   The organisation must provide for the initial configuration and ongoing management of firewalls
-   Each firewall device must have its own set of configuration rules regulating its actions
-   Firewall policy configuration is usually complex and difficult
-   Configuring firewall policies is both an art and a science
-   When security rules conflict with the performance of business, security often loses
-   Best practices for firewalls
    -   All traffic from the trusted network is allowed out
    -   Firewall device is never directly accessed from public network
    -   Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) data are allowed to pass through firewall
    -   Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) data are denied
        -   ICMPs ensure that data reaches the correct place
        -   ICMP can also be used by a potential adversary to perform reconnaissance against a target network
    -   Telnet access to internal servers should be blocked
    -   When Web services are offered outside the firewall, HTTP traffic should be blocked from reaching internal networks
    -   All data not verifiably authentic should be denied
-   Firewall rules
    -   FIrewalls operate by examining data packets and performing comparison with predetermined logical rules
    -   The logic is based on a set of guidelines most commonly referred to as firewall rules, rule base, or firewall logic
    -   Most firewalls use packet header information to determine whether specific packet should be allowed or denied

## Content Filters (Not a Firewall)

-   Software filter - allows administrators to restrict content access from within a network
-   Essentially a set of scripts or programs restricting user access to certainnetworking protocols/Internet locations
-   Primary purpose to restrict internal access to external material
-   Most common content filters restrict users from acccessing non-business websites or deny incoming spam

## Protecting Remote Connections

-   Installing Internetwork connections requires leased lines or other data channels; these connections are usually secured under the requirements of a formal service agreement
-   When individuals seek to connect to an organisation's network, a more flexible optino must be provided
-   Ooptions such as virtual private networks (VPNs) have becomemore popular due to the spread of internet

## Remote Access

-   Unsecured, dial-up connection points represent a substantial exposure to attack
-   Attacker can use a device called a **war dialer** to locate the connection points
-   War dialer: automatic phone-dialing program that dials every number in a configured range and records number if the modem picks up
-   Some technologies (RADIUS systesms, TACACS, CHAP password systems) have improved the authentication process

## VPNs

-   Private and secure network connection between systems; uses data communication capability of unsecured and public network
-   Securely extends organisations' internal network connections to remote locations
-   3 VPN technologies defined
    1. Trusted VPN: Private circuits leased from a trusted communications provider
    2. Secure VPN: Send encrypted traffic over the public internet
    3. Hybrid VPN (Combines trusted and secure): Using a secure VPN over a trusted VPN
-   VPNs must accomplish the following
    -   Encapsulation of incoming and outgoing data
    -   Encryption of incoming and outgoing data
    -   Authentication of remote computer and perhaps remote user as well
-   In most common implementation, it allows the user to turn internet into a private network

### Transport Mode VPN

-   Data within IP packet is encrypted, but header information is not
-   Allows users to establish secure link directly with remote host, encrypting only data contents of packet
-   2 popular uses
    1. End-to-end transport of encrypted data
    2. Remote access worker connects to office network over internet by connecting to a VPN server on the perimeter

### Tunnel Mode VPN

-   Establishes 2 perimeter tunnel servers to encrypt all traffic that will traverse unsecured networks
-   Entire client package encrypted and added as data portion of packet from one tunneling server to another
-   Primary benefit to this model is that an intercepted packet reveals nothing about the true destination system
-   Example of tunnel mode VPN: Microsoft's Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server

# Hardware and Physical Security

# Computer Hardware

- There are many parts inside a computer
    - Memory
    - Motherboard
    - Sound and video card
    - Power supply
    - Network card
    - BIOS
    - Hard disk drive

- Memory: When a computer processes information, it uses programs which requires a certain amount of electronic memory called RAM (Random Access Memory). When the computer is turned off, data in RAM is lost
- ROM (Read only memory) on the other hand is permanent, holds the information that was built into it

## Motherboard

- Each computer has a motherboard with ties all the parts together
- Allows all parts of the computer to receive power, and communicate with one another

## Sound, Video, BIOS, Network Cards

- Sound and Video cards
    - Contain special circuits that allow computers to play sounds or display graphics on the monitor
- BIOS chip
    - Wakes up the computer when it is turned on
    - Reminds computer what parts it has, and what each part can do
- Network card
    - Allows computer to be connected to the internet

## Hard Disk Drive

- A magnetic storage device, where computer programs and files you create and save are stored at
- Is permanent storage, usually denoted by a capital letter (C)
- Modern hard drives can store large amounts of information (E.g. 4TB)
- Made up of steel circular disks that has many tracks, cylinders
- An electronic reading device called the **head** passes back and forth along the cylinders, reading information from the disk or writing to it
- Uses **magnetic recording techniques**, and can be easily erased and rewritten

### Data in Hard Disks

- Data is stored on hard disks as files
- A file is a named collection of bytes
- No matter what the file contains, a file is simply a string of bytes
- When a computer program requests a file, hard disk retrieves its bytes, and sends them to the CPU one at a time

### Storing Data 

- Data is stored on the surface of the platter (the steel cylinders) in sectors and tracks
- Tracks are concentric circles, and sectors are pie-shaped wedges on the track
- A sector contains a fixed number of bytes -- e.g. 256 bytes or 512 bytes
- Either at the drive or the operating system level, sectors are often grouped together into clusters

### Removing Unnecessary Files

- Everytime you run a program, install, uninstall, go to the web etc., junk files are left behind. It is good practice to remove these junk files
- Use **Disk Cleanup** utility in the System Tools folder

### Checking Disk Integrity

- In windows, there is a utility called **Scan Disk**
- Located in the System Tools folder with the Disk Cleanup utility.
- Scan Disk checks the hard drive for errors in the file system, and attempts to fix any errors found

### Defragging Hard Drive

- As you use your computer, some files become fragmented (Part of the file is stored in one location, while another part is stored in another location)
- This slows down performance when trying to read the entire file
- Defragging a hard drive will move all the contents of a single file to be in a single location, to improve performance

## Solid State Drive (SSDs)

- Performs the same functionality as a hard drive, however, data is stored on interconnected flash-memory chips that retain the data even when no power is flowing through them
- These flash chips are also used in USB drives, however, the ones used in SSDs are more reliable, consistent and faster than the ones in USB drives of the same capacities
- SSDs are often smaller than HDDs therefore offer manufacturers more flexibility when designing a PC
- While SSDs can take the place of a 3.5" or 2.5" hard drive bay, SSDs can also be installed in PCIE expansion slots, or connected directly to the motherboard
- HDD technology is relatively ancient compared to SSD technology
- HDDs are cheaper than SSDs
- SSDs are a lot faster than HDDs
- SSDs contain no moving parts, hence are more likely to keep your data safe if you drop your laptop
- Even the quietest HDDs will make noise (due to the moving parts) however all SSDs are quiet due to the lack of moving parts

# How Files are Created, Deleted, Destroyed

## File Creation

When a file is created,
1. An entry is made into the file allocation table (FAT) to indicate where the actual data is stored in the data area
2. Directory entry is made to indicate file size, name, link to FAT, etc.
3. Data is written to the corresponding data area

## File Deletion

When a file is deleted,
1. The FAT entry for that file is zeroed out, and the space it used to occupy on the hard drive is now available to be written over
2. The first character of the directory entry file name is changed to a special character

Nothing is done to the data area

## File Restoration

When a file is restored,
1. FAT entry for that file is linked again to the location in which the data was stored
2. The first character of the directory entry file name is changed to a legal character

- Nothing is done to the data area
- Before disposing any digital device with secondary storage, it is important that the device's hard drive is completely free of data
- Physically smashing the drive is often not good enough
- Formatting the disk does not erase the data off the disk, only the address tables. Hence formatting the disk to remove all data is not 100% secure
- Need to disk wipe (or disk sanitise) or overwrite data with random bits

# Physical Security

- Physical security is also known as infrastructure security
- Protects the information systems that contain data and the people who use, operate and maintain the system
- Must prevent any type of physical access/intrusion that can compromise security
- Protect physical assets that support the storage and processing of sensitive information
- For information systems, the role of physical security is to protect the physical assets that support the storage and processing of information
- Physical security requires 2 complementary requirements
    1. Physical security must prevent damage to the physical infrastructure that sustains the information system. In broad terms, this security must include the following:
        - Information system hardware: Includes data processing and storage equipment, transmission and networking facilities, and offline storage media
        - Physical facilities: The buildings and other structures that house the system and network components
        - Supporting facilities: This category includes electrical power, communication services and environmental controls (heat, humidity etc.)
        - Personnel: Humans involved in the control, maintenance and use of the information systems
    2. Physical security must prevent the misuse of the physical infrastructure, such as vandalism, theft and unauthorised entry

## Physical Security Threats

Physical security threats refer to physical situations and occurrences that threaten information systems. It is important to understand the spectrum of threats to information systems so that responsible administrators can ensure prevention measures are comprehensive.

Physical threats can be categorised into:

- Environmental threats
- Technical threats
- Human-caused threats

Even though natural disasters are a prime source of environmental threats, there are also other sources of environmental threats. Technical and human-caused threats are also important to consider as well

### Characteristics of Environmental Threats

 |                     | Warning                                          | Evacuation                | Duration                                  |
 | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
 | Tornado             | Advanced warning of potential, not site specific | Remain at site            | Brief but intense                         |
 | Hurricane           | Significant advanced warning                     | May require evacuation    | Hours to few days                         |
 | Earthquake          | No warning                                       | May be unable to evacuate | Brief duration, threat of aftershocks     |
 | Ice storm/Blizzards | Several days warning generally expected          | May be unable to evacuate | Few days                                  |
 | Lightning           | Sensors may provide minutes of warning           | May require evacuation    | Brief but may recur                       |
 | Flood               | Several days in advance                          | May be unable to evacuate | Site may be isolated for extended periods |

 - Natural disasters are a source of a wide range of environmental threats to information security systems
 - Tornadoes, hurricanes, cyclones are among the most devastating natural hazards. Substantial structural damage may occur, and damage to outside equipment at a particular site
 - Earthquakes may also cause significant damage, and usually occur without warning. Facilities near the epicenter of an earthquake may suffer catastrophic damage, with significant long-lasting damage to other data centers and information security facilities
 - Ice storms/blizzards may cause some disruption or damage to IS facilities
 - Consequences of lightning strikes range from no damage to disaster
 - Flood damage can be severe, with long-lasting impacts that take major clean-up efforts

### Water Damage

Water and other liquids stored at close proximity to computers also pose a threat 
- Electrical shorts
- Pipe burst from a fault in the line or freezing
- Sprinkler systems accidentally set off
- Floodwater leaving a muddy residue and suspended material in water
- Due diligence should be performed to ensure that water as far as 2 floors away do not pose a hazard to computers

### Chemical, Radiological and Biological Hazards

- Chemical, radiological and biological hazards pose a growing threat from both intentional release and accidental discharge
- None of these agents should be present in an information system environment, however accidental or intentional intrusion is still possible
- Nearby discharges can be introduced through ventilation systems or open windows, and in the case of radiation, through perimeter walls
- Discharges in the vicinity may disrupt work by causing evacuations to be ordered
- Flooding may also introduce biological or chemical contaminants
- In general, the primary risk is towards personnel. Radiation and chemical agents may cause damage to electronic equipment

### Dust and Infestation

Dust is often overlooked
- Rotating storage media and computer fans are most vulnerable to dust damage
- Can block ventilation
- Influx of dust may be a result of
    - Controlled explosion of nearby buildings
    - Windstorm carrying debris
    - Construction/maintenance work in the building

Infestation can also cause damage
- Covers a broad range of living organisms
- High-humidity conditions can cause mold and mildew 
- Insects, particularly those that attack wood and paper (silverfish, termites)

## Technical Threats

- Electrical power is essential to run equipment, however it can also cause damage. Generally split into the following categories

1. Undervoltage
2. Overvoltage 
3. Noise

### Undervoltage

When IS equipment receives less power than what is required
- Occurs due to temporary dips to electrical power, to brownouts (prolonged undervoltage)
- Most computers are designed to withstand prolonged voltage reductions of up to 20% without shutting down and without operational errors

### Overvoltage

When IS equipment receives more power than what is required
- More serious than undervoltage
- Voltage surge may destroy silicon-based components, including processors and memories

### Noise

Noise refers to interference from the external environment, such as electromagnetic inteference (EMI)
- Noise along power supply line, motor fans, heavy equipment, other computers, cell phones, microwave relay antennaes and relay stations
- Noise can be transmitted through space as well as through power lines
- Can cause intermittent problems with computers

## Human Caused Threats

### Unauthorised Physical Access

Those without proper authorisation are not allowed to access certain portions of the building, unless accompanied by an authorised individual

Information assets such as servers, mainframe computers, network equipment and storage networks are generally located in a restricted area, with access limited to a small number of employees. Unauthorised physical access can lead to other threats such as theft/vandalism/misuse

### Theft

Theft of equipment and theft of data by copying. Eavesdropping and wiretapping also fall under this category. Theft can be at the hands of an outsider who has gained unauthorised access, or by an insider.

### Vandalism

Destruction of equipment and data

### Misuse

Improper use of resources by those who are authorised to do use them, as well as the use of resources by those unauthorised to use them

### Physical Access Controls

- Secure facilities: Physical locations with control implemented to minimise risk of threats from physical sources
- Secure facilities can take advantage of terrain, local traffic flow etc. (fences, guards, gates, alarms etc.)
- Physical security controls include
    - Walls, fencing, gates
        - Some of the oldest and most reliable elements of physical security; the essential starting point for perimeter control
    - Guards
        - Can evaluate each situation as it arises and make reasonable responses; most have standard operating procedures
    - Dogs
        - Keen sense of smell and hearing, can easily detect intrusion that human guards cannot
    - ID Cards or badges
        - ID Card typically concealed, name badge is visible
        - Serves as simple form of biometrics (facial recognition)
        - Should not be the only means of control as cards can be easily duplicated, stolen or modified
        - Tailgating occurs when an authorised individual opens a door and other people also enter
    - Locks and keys
        - 2 types of locks: Mechanical and electronic
        - Locks can be divided into 4 categories: Manual, programmable, electronic, biometric
        - Locks can fail, and alternative procedures for controlling access must be put in place
    - Mantraps
        - Small enclosure that has an entry point, and a different exit point
        - Individuals enter mantrap, requests access, and if verified, is allowed to exit mantrap in to the facility
        - Individuals denied entry are not allowed to exit unless security official overrides the automatic locks of the enclosure
    - Electronic monitoring
        - Equipment can record events in areas where physical controls are impractical
        - May use cameras with video recorders; includes closed circuit television (CCTV) systems
        - However, it is passive, and does not prevent unauthorised access or prohibited activity
        - Recordings are often not monitored in real time, must be reviewed to be of any value
    - Alarms
        - Notify people/systems when an event occurs
        - Detect fire, intrusions, environmental disturbance, or interruption in services
        - Rely on sensors that detect events. E.g. motion detectors, thermal sensors etc.
    - Computer rooms and wiring closets
        - Require special attention to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability of information
        - Logical access controls are easily defeated if attacker gains physical access to computing equipment
        - Custodial staff, often the least scrutinised people who have access to offices, are given the greatest degree of supervised access
    - Interior walls and doors
        - Information asset security is sometimes compromised by improper construction of facility walls and doors
        - Facility walls are typically standard interior walls or firewalls
        - High-security areas must have at least firewall-grade security walls to provide physical security against potential intruders and fires
        - Doors allowing access to high-security rooms to be evaluated
        - To secure doors, install push or crash bars on computer rooms and closets

### Fire Security and Safety

- The most serious threat to the safety of people who work in an organisation is fire
- Fires account for more property damage, personal injury, and death than any other threat
- Imperative that physical security plans implement strong measures against preventing, detecting and responding to fires

#### Fire Detection and Response

Fire suppression systems: Devices installed and maintained to respond to a fire, potential fire or combustion danger
- Flame point: Temperature of ignition
- Deny an environment of temperature, fuel or oxygen
- Water and water mist systems
- Carbon dioxide systems
- Soda acid systems
- Gas based systems

#### Fire Detection

- Fire detection falls into 2 categories: Manual and automatic
- To prevent attackers from slipping into offices during an evacuation, programs often designate a person from each office area to serve as a floor monitor
- 3 basic types of fire detection systems: Thermal detection, smoke detection and flame detection

#### Fire Suppression

- Systems can consist of portable, manual or automatic apparatus
- Portable extinguishers are rated by the type of fire: Class A, B, C, D, K
    - A: Ordinary combustibles, such as wood, paper etc.
    - B: Flammable liquids, such as oil, grease, paint etc.
    - C: Live electrical equipment, such as electrical panels, motor wiring etc.
    - D: Combustible metals, such as magnesium, sodium etc.
    - K: Commercial cooking equipment, such as cooking oil, animal fats, vegetable oils etc.
- Installed systems apply suppressive agents, usually either sprinkler or gaseous system

#### Heating, Ventilation and Air-conditioning

- Areas within heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems can cause damage to information systems include:
    - Temperature
    - Filtration
    - Humidity
    - Static electricity

- Ventilation shafts
    - While ductwork is small in residential buildings, in large commerical buildings ventilation shafts are large enough for an entire person to crawl through
    - If ducts are large, security can install wire mesh grids at various points to compartmentalise the runs
- Power management and conditioning
    - Power systems used by information-processing equipment must be properly installed and grounded
    - Noise that inteferes with the normal 60hz cycle can result in inaccurate time clocks, or unreliable internal CPU clocks
- Grounding
    - Grounding ensures that returning flow of a current is properly discharged into the ground
    - Overloading a circuit can create load exceeding the electrical cable's rating, increasing risk of overheating and fire
- Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
    - In case of power outage, UPS is the backup power source for major computing systems
    - Basic UPS configuration
        - Standby
        - Line interactive
        - Standby online hybrid
        - Double conversion online
        - Data conversion online
        - Emergency shutoff
            - Important aspect of power management is the ability to stop power immediately if the current represents a risk to human or machine safety
            - Most computer rooms and wiring closets are equipped with an emergency power shutoff

### Other Detections and Problems

- Water problems
    - Lack of water poses a threat to computer systems as well, including fire suprression systems and air-conditioning systems
    - Surplus of water also poses a threat to computer systems, such as flooding or leaks
    - Important to integrate water detection systems into alarm systems that regulate overall facility operations
- Structural collapse
    - Unavoidable environmental factors can cause structural damage in the system
    - Structures are designed and constructed with specific load limits. Overloading these limits may result in structural failure and potential injury or loss of life
    - Periodic inspections by qualified civil engineers assist in identifying potentially dangerous structural conditions

### Securing Mobile and Portable Systems

- Mobile computing requires more security than typical computing infrastructures
- Many mobile computing systems have sensitive corporate information stored within them
- Some are configured to facilitate the user's access into the organisation's secure computing systems
- Controls support security and retrieval for lost and stolen laptops
- CompuTrace software, stored on laptops, reports to a central monitoring center
- Burglar alarms made up of a PC card that contains a motion detector

## Consideration for Physical Security Threats

- Develop physical security in-house or outsource
- There are many qualified and professional agencies
- Benefit of outsourcing includes gaining experience and knowledge of agencies
- Downsides include expensive, loss of control over individual components, and level of trust that must be placed on the other company
- Social Engineering: Should train staff so that they do not release information via social engineering attacks
- Inventory Management
    - Computing equipment should be inventoried and inspected on a regular basis
    - Classified information should also be inventoried and managed
    - Physical security of computing equipment, data storage media and classified documents varies for each organisation

# Summary

- Threats to information security systems are unique to physical security
- Each facility must make key physical security considerations
- There are many types of physical security monitoring components
- Each facility must have essential elements of access control in place
- Each facility must also have essential elements of access controls in place
- Fire safety, fire detection and response must be implemented
- Importance of supporting facilities, especially use of uninterruptible power supplies is important
- Countermeasures to physical theft of computing devices must be in place

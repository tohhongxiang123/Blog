# Planning for Security

- Policies, standards and practices are the foundation of IS architecture and blueprint
- Coordinated planning required to create and maintain these elements
- Strategic planning for management and allocation of resources
- Contingency planning for preparations under uncertain business environments

# Information Security Planning and Governance

- Planning levels help translate organisational strategic plans into tactical objectives
- Planning and the CISO
- Information security governance
    - Set of responsibilities and practices exercised by the board and management executives
    - Goal to provide strategic direction, establishment of objectives, and measurement of progress toward objectives
    - Also verifies/validates that risk management practices are appropriate and assets used properly
- Outcomes of information security governance
    - Strategic alignment
    - Risk management
    - Resource management
    - Performance measures
    - Value delivery

# Policies, Standards and Practice

- Policies are the base of all IS planning, design and deployment
- Direct how issues should be addressed and how technologies are used
- Should not contradict laws, must be able to stand up in court, must be properly administered
- Policies are least expensive to execute, but most difficult to implement properly
- Policies are the organisational law that dictates acceptable/unacceptable behavior
- Standards are more detailed statements of what must be done to comply with the policy
- Practices and procedures and guidelines explain how to comply with the policy
- For a policy to be effective, must be properly disseminated, read, understood and agreed by all members of an organisation and uniformly enforced

# Policy Management

- Policies must be managed as they constantly change
- To remain viable, security policies must have
    - A responsible manager
    - A schedule of reviews
    - A method for making recommendations for reviews
    - A policy issuance and revision date
    - Automated policy management

# Security Models

- ISO 27000 Series
- NIST Security Models

# Design of Security Architecture
- Spheres of security - Foundation of the security framework
- Levels of control
    - Management control sets the direction and scope oft he security processes and provide detailed instructions for its conduct
    - Operation control addresses personnel and physical security, and the protection of production inputs/outputs
    - Technical controls are the tactical and technical implementations related to designing and integrating security in the organisation

- Defense in depth
    - Impleentation of security in layers
    - Organisation establish multiple layers of security controls and safeguards
- Security perimeter
    - Border of security protecting internal systems from outside threats
    - Does not protect against internal attacks from employee threats or onsite physical threats

# Security Education, Training and Awareness Program (SETA)

- After setting policies, we need to implement security education, training and awareness (SETA) program
- SETA is a control measure designed to reduce accidental security breaches
- Consists of security education, security training and security awareness
- Enhances security by improving awareness, developing skills and knowledge and building in-depth knowledge

# Security Education

- Everyone in an organisation needs to be trained and aware of information security
- When formal education is deemed appropriate, an employee can investigate courses in continuihng education from local institutions of higher learning
- A number of universities have formal coursework in information security

# Security Awareness

- One of the least frequently implement but most beneficial programs is the security awareness program
- Designed to keep information security at the forefront of users' minds
- Need not be complicated or expensive
- If program is not actively implemented, employees may begin to neglect security matters, and security risk increases

# Continuity Strategies

- Incident response plans (IRPs), disaster recovery plans (DRPs), business continuity plans (BCPs)
- IRP focuses on **immediate responses**; if attack escalates or is disastrous, process changes to disaster recovery and BCP
- DRP typically focuses on **restoring systems** after disasters occur; as such, closely associated with BCP
- BCP occurs concurrently with DRP when damage is major or ongoing, requiring more than simple restoration of information and information resources

# Contingency Planning (CP) Process

Includes the following steps

- Develop CP policy statement
- Conduct business impact analysis
- Identify preventive controls
- Create contingency strategies
- Develop contingency plan
- Ensure plan testing, training and exercises
- Ensure plan maintenance

# CP Policy

Should contain the following sections

- Introductory statement of philosophical perspective
- Statement of scope/purpose
- Call for periodic risk assessment or business impact analysis
- Specification of CP's major components
- Call for, or request guidance in the selection of recovery options
- Requirement to test the various plans regularly
- Identification of key regulations and standards
- Identification of key people responsible for CP
- Challenge to organisation members for support
- Administrative information

# Business Impact Analysis

- Investigation and assessment of various adverse events that can affect organsation
- Assumes security controls have been bypassed, have failed, have proven ineffective, and attack has succeeded
- Organisation should consider scope, plan, balance, knowledge of objectives, and follow-ups
- Three stages
    - Determine mission/business processes that have been affected, and how critical it is to recover from it
    - Identify recovery priorities for system resources
    - Indentify resource requirements

# Incident Response Planning (IRP)

- Includes identification of, classification of, and response to an incident
- Attacks classified as incidents if they
    - Are directed against information assets
    - Have a realistic chance of success
    - Could threaten confidentiality, integrity and availability of information resources
- More reactive than proactive, with the exception that planning has to occur so that incident response team will be ready to respond to an incident

# Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP)

- DRP is preparation for, and recover from a disaster
- The contingency planning team must consider what constitutes as a "disaster" and what constitutes as an "incident"
    - Usually a disaster is an event where the organisation cannot recover from it in real time, or that the level of damage caused is extremely severe and switft recovery is impossible
- When situations are classified as disasters, plans change as to how to respond; take action to secure the most valuable assets to preserve value for the longer term
- DRP strives to reestablish operations at the primary site

# Business Continuity Planning (BCP)

- Prepares an organisation to reestablish or relocate business-critical operations to a secondary site, if the primary site is affected by a disaster
- If a disaster renders the current site unoperable, contingency plans must be in place on how to allow a business to continue functioning
- Development of BCP is usually easier than development of DRP or IRP because BCP primarily consists of choosing a continuity strategy and integrating off-site data storage and recovery functions into this strategy

# Crisis Management

- Actions taken to minimise loss of life/resources, preserve organisation's image/market share, and complement disaster recovery or business continuity processes
- What can distinguish between an incident and a disaster is the actions of the response team
- Disaster recovery personnel must know their roles without any supporting documentation
    - Preparation
    - Training
    - Rehearsal

# The Consolidated Security Plan

- Single document set approach combines all aspects of contingency policy and plan, incoporating IR, DR and BC plans
- Often created and stored electronically, should be easily accessible by employees in times of need
    - Small and medium sized companies may also store hard copies of the document


# Summary

- Development, maintenance and enforcement of information security policies, standards, guidelines, practices, procdures are important
- Information security education, training, awareness (SETA) is a control measure that reduces accidental security breaches and increases organisational resistance to many forms of attack
- Contingency planning is made up of 3 components
    - Incident response planning
    - Disaster recovery planning
    - Business continuity planning

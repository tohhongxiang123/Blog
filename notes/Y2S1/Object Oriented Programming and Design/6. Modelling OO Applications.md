# Modelling OO Applications

- The primary goal of OO is to model real-world systems in ways similar to ways people think
- Identify objects - encapsulated data and behavior
- Model how objects interact with real-world objects
- Identify classes
  - Entity
  - Boundary
  - Control
- Add attributes and methods
- Add class relationshipos
- Add multiplicities
